    "The quantum circuit\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "For this basic tutorial, we will consider a special subset of CV operations:\n",
    "the *Gaussian transformations*. We work with the following simple Gaussian circuit:\n",

    "What is this circuit doing?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **We begin with one wire (qumode) in the vacuum state**. Note that we use the same\n",
    "   notation $|0\\rangle$ for the initial state as the previous qubit tutorial.\n",
    "   In a photonic CV system, this state is the *vacuum state*, i.e., the state with no\n",
    "   photons in the wire.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **We displace the qumode**. The displacement gate linearly shifts the state of the\n",
    "   qumode in phase space. The vacuum state is centered at the origin in phase space,\n",
    "   while the displaced state will be centered at the point $\\alpha$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **We rotate the qumode**. This is another linear transformation in phase space,\n",
    "   albeit a rotation (by angle $\\phi$) instead of a displacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Finally, we measure the mean photon number** $\\langle\\hat{n}\\rangle =\n",
    "   \\langle\\hat{a}^\\dagger \\hat{a}\\rangle$. This quantity, which tells us the average amount of\n",
    "   photons in the final state, is proportional to the energy of the photonic system.\n"

    "The displacement gate is an *active transformation*, which modifies the energy of the\n",
