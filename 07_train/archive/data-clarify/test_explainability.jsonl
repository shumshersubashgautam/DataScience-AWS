{"features":["I've used Taxcut\/H&R Block At Home for about 10 years now.  I bought this year's version after having skipped last year in favor of a professional tax preparer, as my wife is now self-employed and I needed help with last year's return.  After pretty much doing most of the work myself and spending nearly $400, I decided to go back to this software.<br \/><br \/>I purchased the Premium and Business 2012 since the descriptions &#34;appeared&#34; to describe my needs.  But no -- in fact, I did NOT need the business software (after spending the extra dollars).  I felt this was somewhat deceptively marketed as needed, even though my wife is a sole proprietor.<br \/><br \/>After a few minutes to install, I was off and running.  But...the old memories of a not-quite self-explanatory interview haunted me once again.  Questions, esp. on her 401K and our recharacterization of IRAs, were vague, no FAQs offered, and I ended up figuring it out by trial and error.  Additionally, the section covering her business costs left me wondering if the automobile should or should not be depreciated (not - we used standard mileage).<br \/><br \/>Overall, I am giving it 3 stars -- its' okay, and certainly better than shelling out $400 to a company that (a) didn't really do a lot for me except most of the work myself and (b) I'm now certain missed some deductions.  Still -- H&R Block -- you MUST do a better job on the tax interview GUIs and materials.  PLEASE!","Digital_Software"]}
{"features":["HR Block has sunk to new lows in product design. (1) Even before the product starts, the user learns they have to change display settings to use.If you have a laptop, their advice does not address the problem that one cannot see the whole screen or reach the buttons to move through the screen.  (2) Then, the product demands the user activate it. I did not receive their promised activation email, but I did pay for the product.  Usually, that is sufficient for companies to deliver working products, but not here.  It is obviously some kind of marketing gimmick to put the user on a mailing list and be subject to pestering about how to account for next year's taxes even before the year is over.<br \/><br \/>Do not bother to waste your time and experience the frustration of putting into a hole that yields nothing.

I emailed iObit and asked them several questions: \"How do I turn off the firewall?\", \"If I uninstall the program, how do I reinstall it?\", \"Could it be interfering with Windows Defender?\", etc. The response didn't answer any of my questions; it appeared to be a canned answer without regard to my problems.

There is lots of repetition built into the lesson plans which really helps to reinforce what you are learning. The one aspect I was extremely disappointed about was learning after 3 months that my access to the online component had expired. The online component includes the ability to interact with other students, speak with tutors, play games and read stories. It is also much more user friendly than the software version. The description offered on amazon was completely misleading regarding what was included in the price and what was not. The description mentions the online lessons, practice sessions, online community and games. The description does not mention that any of these features expire. The only mention of a three month trial period is in the description of the mobile apps (&#34;Enhance your learning on-the-go with Rosetta Stone mobile apps for the Kindle Fire HD, iPad and iPhone.

My Credit Union blocks Mint and Quicken, so it was a wash there and I don't hold that against them.  But my Sallie Mae account?  Mint can access it and always has.  Quicken?  Not so much.  My ADP 401k?  Mint always accessed it, Quicken 2012 cannot.  My mortgage, which is supported in Mint, also not supported in Quicken 2012 PREMIERE.  Really?  These are not small financial institutions like my credit union, these are the \"big boys\" in their field.<br \/><br \/>So, if I wanted to import this data manually, what kind of support is there?  A long time ago (Quicken 98) you used to be able to pull .csv files and update accounts directly like that.  Oh no, not in 2012.  You see, importing static data is not allowed to go into anything but a specific type of loan account.  Not checkings, savings, 401k, credit, ect.  So you have to import it to a loan, then copy and paste it where it is supposed to be.  That is the solution I found in Quicken's forum.<br \/><br \/>Needless to say, you are paying a not insignificant sum of money for a product that is less universal than Mint.  For the ONE account that I have that Quicken can access, it works great and I love the data management and analytic summaries.  However, given that Mint is the SAME COMPANY, I expected more account integration.  Given my past experience with Quicken, I expected data importation to be less painful.<br \/><br \/>My verdict, look closely to insure all your accounts are supported before you buy.  If they are, you'll love the product.  If not, go with something else.<br \/><br \/>I wish I had never wasted the money on this software.

Unfortunately, the versions 2014 and 2015 were a step backwards in usability. 2014 has many focus issues, where the cursor does not appear when switching between applications; it is also much slower than the previous versions, and has several drawing\/repainting issues.  Some of those issues were fixed in 2015, but not all of them.  I'm still using Quicken because I have all of my accounts and rental properties already setup, but the experience with it has turned negative. I used to be a big fan and recommended Quicken to anyone.  But now, if you're a new user looking for something to keep track of your accounts, I would recommended researching other accounting software before investing in Quicken.  It is very disappointing that Quicken and Intuit have let so many poor quality issues appear in their product with the 2014 version.  I would have remained a devoted user with the older version 2011, but I was forced to upgrade to 2014 (and then 2015) because they were discontinuing the online bank synchronization with the older versions.

Error messages during the installation do not permit use of the software.<br \/><br \/>Help is not readily available from Adobe. If you are persistent (read \"very\" persistent and you have some time to squander) you can navigate their customer support webpage to arrive at a place where you can enter or open a discussion forum with the hope that another consumer can help you resolve your problem.

Remember the day when reputable and responsible companies actually stood behind their product? When dealing with Adobe that memory will find no cause to be recalled.<br \/><br \/>Note that Adobe's advertisement provides an assurance that their software is compatible with Windows operating platforms.

{"features":["I completed a return using both HR and TT online and cannot imagine using this program if you have any investment income or take any credits.  The first and most basic problem was that HR couldn't download my 1099-DIV or 1099-B from my bank.  It is one of the largest banks in the country, and TT had was able to import.  I'd check online to see if HR (or TT) can import from your bank or you will spend a lot of time doing what you are trying to avoid by buying this!      Second, HR was unclear about capital gains and losses.  Had I used only HR, I very well could have reported a gain instead of a loss! To be fair, if it had imported the forms, it might have figured it out.  Even once I figured out where to enter the various numbers, I used the numbers from TT instead of entering the cost basis for every small transaction (and to calculate the basis with HR you'll have to use another (free) program).     Generally, the HR program is clunky:  TT asks you questions and tells you what your answer means; HR just tells you to click if you qualify for the \"1044 exemption for standing on your head.\"  I've done my taxes on my own every year til now, and HR was basically the same thing.  In the end, because investment income is confusing -even if you have a small amount- it is well worth paying for a program. But I'm very glad I didn't try to use HR's program.

{"features":["I've been using Quicken for many years.  It always does the job in a not too impressive fashion.  The 2011 version has some nice features.  I especially appreciate being able to import transactions from my bank accounts. Quicken makes you \"upgrade\" every few years or you lose the ability to download. (Nice guys!)    The program itself acts a bit buggy at times but if you keep trying it will work.    Before I bought Quicken Deluxe 2011 I looked all around for alternatives but did not find anything that would work for me. MS Money is no longer available.  I looked at several others including MINT.  The big problem with all of the others (that I found) is that they keep your transaction data on their \"cloud\".  Transactions made more than 90 days or so before the current date are not available. Makes it tough come Tax time.","Digital_Software"]}
{"features":["I use Quicken to track my finances because I absolutely don't feel comfortable with having my financial information stored on computers I don't control (if I did, I'd use Mint instead of Quicken). I've been using Quicken 2013 for the past couple of years. It had a couple of quirks, but it worked decently well and I didn't really have a reason to upgrade to 2014. I recently added a few new accounts that weren't auto-updating, so I figured it'd be a good time to upgrade and see if they would with 2015.  Right off the bat, as soon as I installed, I was forced to sign in with an online ID--you can't use Quicken 2015 without signing in online. This immediately gave me pause; since I didn't want my information stored on their servers, why is an online ID necessary? After about 10 minutes of considering what to do, I decided to sniff the network traffic coming off of my computer and forge ahead, making sure that nothing I didn't want to went off of my machine.  I already use TurboTax (a product I like a lot), so I already had an ID I could use. But just signing in wasn't enough--I was also forced to enter my name and address and say where I purchased Quicken. Then an option came up about syncing with my phone, which I obviously didn't want to do, so I opted out, though I would have preferred it to be opt-in instead of opt-out. There were another couple of screens prompting me to convert my local password database into something encrypted with my online ID instead, which I again had to opt out of. I hadn't even started using it yet, but I was already rather frustrated with how difficult and intrusive what I thought was going to be a quick upgrade turned out to be.  Once I did finally get into Quicken itself, I found that the program was unbelievably full of bugs. The most frustrating one is that the window has a problem painting itself (it basically goes blank) if I expand the width to be wider than 1920 pixels. My main monitor is 3840x2160, so I can only use it snapped tohalf the screen. Quicken 2013 handled being full screen at high resolution just fine. Trying to shove all the columns I'm used to into half the screen space means that I either have to scroll to see everything or shrink the columns so that I can't see as much info as I want per column. Huge regression in usability.  There are lots of other glitches too--often, the column titles are smaller than the width of the data columns, so they're not lined up until I click on them to try to resize. The most severe thing I've found is that if I'm in an investment account, and I click the &#34;Tools&#34; menu, Quicken crashes. 100% reproducible.  After looking at the HTTP requests it was making, I'm satisfied that all my information is being stored only locally. Each time I update my accounts, I see requests going out to all of my banks and data coming back directly from them, which is exactly what I want. Annoyingly, upgrading didn't fix the auto-update on the accounts that weren't updating (but I haven't played around with it too much yet or tried to reconfigure it since upgrading).  Overall, I hated the upgrade process, and I hate the direction that Quicken is heading. Intuit owns both Quicken and Mint, so why does it seem to feel the need to make Quicken the same thing as Mint? I'm sure there's a market for people who don't want their aggregated financial information stored online, yet still want to have automatic import of data from banks. But, for me the big thing isn't the one-time upgrade process but the product you're left with after that you'll use on a regular basis. It does technically work, but the serious bugs I've seen are a huge step backward. I figured that waiting for several months after the initial release would mean I'd get pretty stable software, but that's definitely not the case. I'll keep using it for now, but I'm really tempted to go back to the stable Quicken 2013.","Digital_Software"]}

{"features":["I don't know if you can consider what I'm going to write a full review, but it is an overview of some of the changes I've noticed (compared to Office 2010) and what I think about them. It's pretty long because I tried to be really thorough. I mostly use Word and Excel, so I'll talk about those most (I don't use OneNote or PowerPoint much, so I can't comment on them much besides causally things I noticed or read). I will focus on the new Metro\/Windows 8 look that Office now adopts first. It's about flatness, removal of gradients, simulated 3D elements, and round corners. I gave it the benefit of a doubt, and I can use it, but it's not an improvement or benefits productivity. Some defaults implemented are questionable, like \"Why? This offers no benefit.\"<br \/><br \/>==New skins==<br \/>First off is the default white theme. I have no idea who OK'd this decision. It's silly. There's so much white! The top of the window is white, the ribbon is white, the scroll bars are white, drop down menus in the ribbon have to be white, and many of the icons in the ribbon can only be white or off-white by nature and\/or have been changed to white anyways (perfect example is the Insert tab in Word)... all while the work area below the ribbon is usually white too! Everything has a tendency to blend together, and how can it not, since it's all white to begin with. My eye feels like it wants to wander around. And to top it off, the ribbon features low contrast with little color. Things you expect to be black are actually grey or a lightened black (all the fonts used, the outline of the page in Word, the paragraph tools, the separations between columns in the ribbon, the font size increase\/decrease are all examples) and a lot of the color has been toned down and desaturated. This low contrast gives the ribbon an even WHITER feel. Even the separators between groups in the Ribbon has been lightened to grey and are less noticeable. I think their idea was to \"subdue\" everything so it's not competing for attention, but it has the opposite effect. Going back to the Insert Tab in word, it's almost like the icons\/commands available blend in with the background due to all of this and the flatness. Even hovering over an item is somewhat dull. Without any shading, gradients, or contrast, it's like the UI and work area compete with each other. Nothing really \"pops out\" as a control element. Something just feels wrong. In Office 2010, I use the Silver theme (I abhor the default blue theme), which is another non-colored theme, but it has none of the problems of Office 2013. The work area was the focus of attention. And due to the brightness of the white theme too in 2013, if your monitor is not very bright, it can look a little dull, but too bright, and it can be fatiguing. They have two grey themes, light and dark, but they should really be called \"barely darker than stark white\" and \"slightly dark than that\". Both are better for separating elements, so why was white chosen by default? Maybe because they were boring... just flat areas of grey and are not eye candy at all. And about eye candy, not all of the icons could easily take to the new minimalist flat look. Some things like Equation, Symbol, Chart, and Conditional Formatting look good, but other elements look ugly, like the Filter icon, and others are just so basic, like the page tools which are basically white rectangles and do not \"stick out\" from the background like I said earlier. So from the get go, Office has been uglfied.<br \/><br \/>==Ribbon==<br \/>The ribbon also features ALL CAPS IN IT'S SECTIONS, LIKE HOME\/INSERT\/REVIEW\/ETC. You can easily change it, but again, why was this done by default? They said it helped separate the tabs, but this was never an issue in previous versions and many people look to change this when first starting. The ribbon is also vertically longer in ALL programs by a tiny degree. But the worst thing is the new File menu. When you launch the File menu, it overtakes the whole screen, similar to the Windows 8 Start Screen. 2010 does it too, but it opens it up like a Ribbon section... 2013 hides the other ribbon sections and the even File button (it changes it into another icon). It drives me nuts because I HATE how it looks. It's just ugly. Gone are icons for the buttons too, like Open\/Save\/Share\/Export, now they are all just plain text. And when using Open, Save\/Save As, more mouse movement and clicks are necessary to do the same amount of work as 2010 (assuming you don't use SkyDrive, which I don't) due to the \"backstage\" that has been implemented. Same when you launch any program (Word\/Excel\/OneNote) or attempt to create a New Document - now you need to choose a template to start with, or click Escape to get a blank document. This was an annoyance at first but I actually like this feature. It might encourage more people to use\/make templates. You can turn most of these changes off, and I found how to do it quite quickly, but there is no way to turn off the File Menu's Open using the backstage, so now I just pinned it to the quick launch toolbar. They also introduced auto hiding the entire ribbon, but it was implemented how it should be done. Unlike auto hiding the Windows 7 taskbar, you need to click on the 2013 Ribbon after hovering over it to get it to come up. Effectively it requires more one click on every use, when it could have just been on hover over.<br \/><br \/>==Animations + Missing shortcuts==<br \/>The entire suite now features more GPU acceleration than 2010, which is great, and it also brings a new animation fluidity. In Word, the cursor is ever so slightly is behind what you are typing. You can't fully see it, but you can if you just hold down a single key (the cursor is always BEHIND by one character then). I think its fine though, much better than how it worked in the preview. Menus are also a bit \"different\" when they pop out, it's subtle but I like it. Excel also has a different fluidity when selecting cells and selections are colored and sometimes animated. There is a way to disable these changes (via Windows, the Registry, or by just turning off hardware acceleration), but why not make this an option in the program? I know people would use it. Mysteriously absent also is the fast way to use Ruler and Split View in Word and Excel. Before, you used to be able to just drag from the top to create a split view, or use the button below to make the ruler visible, but now you need to manually switch to the View tab and change those options. Why was this implemented? I loved this simple feature. It's anti-productivity by changing it! If they could afford to increase the length of the ribbon (for no reason), they can afford to keep those two shortcuts.<br \/><br \/>==Font Rendering==<br \/>Office 2013 also changed font rendering... fonts now look hideous. It has a look to it that is both blurry and\/or too crisp simultaneously. It's like the font smoothing is too prominent. You can try to fix it via disabling hardware acceleration, subpixel smoothing, or updating your drivers, but none of those methods worked for me. I did some research and found 2 links at Microsoft Answers. I'll save you some time though and summarize: the new rendering (which is also present in Windows 8) does not support ClearType. Why you ask? Well, there is no official answer from MS, but somebody did post a bunch of reasons about it in the context of tablets... ClearType doesn't rotate with the screen, ClearType font animations don't look right, plus their new system is \"good enough\" for high pixel density screens (so much for monitors). The new rendering looks only greyscale too, not RGB based. This whole issue is pathetic. The Metro philosophy emphasized using fonts and typography in design (for I'm assuming a benefit)... yet they can't even get font rending right and offer no flexibility with it. Who is responsible for this!?<br \/><br \/>==Word==<br \/>Word is pretty much the same 2010, changes are sprinkled around. Headings can now be collapsed and I LOVE this feature (the only problem is that it captures ALL non heading text under it, so you may want to work in a table if you only want certain text to be collapsible). The Ribbon now has a Design tab dedicated to Themes, Colors, fonts\/etc (this takes the place of the Change Styles button in the home tab in 2010). One annoying thing though is that when changing styles, you no longer can see a text list of styles... you see a preview now (which is useful) with a text hover over, but having to find a style by look is not as fast as knowing what it's called (and there is no option to change this). The new default fonts and paragraph styles are slightly changed too, there's a new Word 2013 style set (one change is 1.08 line spacing vs 2010 at 1.15). Word also gives an option to return to the exact location where you last saved a document, that's really nice. The reading mode is ok but lacking in options and I don't think of Word as a reading program (especially with the font rendering problems). Several functions that result in popups in 2010 are now in side panels, such as Spelling. And on the subject of spelling, apparently Microsoft doesn't want us to use AutoCorrect much. Autocorrect is removed from right click menus and the spelling panel (it used to be there in 2010). If you use this a lot, to correct words it doesn't catch (such as \"posoin\" > poison), you'll have fun manually digging it out in options every time and then finally entering the changes. The dictionary has been removed too and now you need to sign into a Microsoft Account to use it (since it is an Office Web App now and a MS account is required for all Web Apps), but oddly the thesaurus has been left in place. The bottom status bar (with spelling count, view options, etc) is slightly larger and doesn't show outline or draft in the GUI options. Track Changes has had comments cleaned up, but for some reason it now doesn't tell you when it gets to the end of a section or document (why remove that?). When using CTRL+F for find, you now presented with the less options version stored in the Navigation Panel... more mouse and clicks required to see all options than the Find\/Replace one. So more mouse movement is required for a commonly used feature... One last thing - if you choose to not upgrade, but instead install 2013 alongside 2010, you may run into some problems. 2010 (and occasionally 2013) will sometimes show \"Please wait while Windows configures\" when you start them. They take a LONG time to complete on their own, and even when cancelling them you need to somewhat wait... 2010 gives me an error when I do this and says I need to repair a functionality that is no longer working, but whatever it is must not be critical because it loads after anyways and works just fine. Also, your new blank Documents will launch in 2010 compatibly mode by default in Word 2013 and when saving them, you will get a prompt saying it will upgrade them to the newest format.<br \/><br \/>==Excel==<br \/>Excel has quite a bit of changes. The formula bar and name box are slightly larger, the X and check mark icon always visible, and there is a lot of padding (blank space) around it. Why was this done? It only makes it less compact. In addition, the sheet selection at the bottom is also larger too, so by default, you can now only see 45 cells, not 47. Do elements really need to be more prominent? The entire Layout tab for Charts is gone from the Ribbon too and I find this disappointing. You can manually recreate it again though. I didn't recreate the whole thing, but I tried doing a bit of it to see if I could and I could, so I'm guessing the rest should work too. Anyways, the replacements they've implemented are a text only menu accessed via a + button at the top right when selecting a chart, or a visual version like in 2010 via Design Tab > Chart Layouts > Add Chart Element. Formatting has also been changed a lot too. Instead of being a popup, it's nowa docked panel at the right side and completely reorganized. It contains the same options but everything is somewhat moved around. And if you used PowerPivot, you can kiss it goodbye. The feature has been completely removed. It is now only available in Office 365 (subscription) or the Professional Plus edition, which is the most expensive non subscription version of Office and cannot be bought via retail as it's only available through volume licensing (it's easier to obtain illegally than legally - talk about completely botching this up!). Another thing - remember when I earlier said that a lot of UI elements are grey, not black? Yeah, it applies that style by default to charts too - all the once black elements are now the 35% lighter version. I couldn't find how in program to change this default action to black, but it still uses black as it's automatic color. Like I really want to have to manually change text colors each time now. There is now a Quick Analysis feature at the bottom of data tables, it gives you shortcuts to Conditional Formatting, suggested Tables, Pivots, etc. It reminds me of the Mini Toolbar and when the Ribbon was introduced... it makes common\/useful functions more upfront\/visible for well, people who haven't explored much and don't know everything that is possible. It empowers them by showing them what it capable and a preview. I don't use it that much but it's a nice touch. Also, in PivotTable options, 2013 shows you less things to do yet takes up more space. Now you have to right click to Sort\/Filter as well as \"summarize values by\" and \"show values as\" (can't add those last 2 back to the Ribbon).<br \/><br \/>==Additional Features==<br \/>I don't really use the Cloud features of Office 2013, but I did log into my MS account to see what it could do. Useful if you do use their cloud services. You can open\/save directly to the cloud, email things as attachments, create web browser presentations, and other social media site sharing all within theprogram. You can also post things to blogs (a bunch of third party ones too, like WordPress). Office 2013 also introduces Apps. They're jumping on the app bandwagon, but it's actually a good thing because it helps popularize and consolidate additional functionality, instead of looking for independent add-ons. There's a Word app called \"TaskIt\" that creates task list panel. Simple but really useful. Things are more interesting on the Excel side though. Ablebits\/Tyrant Ventures has a lot of free, useful Excel apps, such as a random number generator (for those who don't want to use a formula and want a random value written directly into a cell), change case options (like in Word, but without having to go to Word), and Range Calculations (for when you want to change a bunch of cells by constant values (add, subtract, etc). Maybe in the future Apps will be something that draws people to upgrade, but right now there aren't loads of apps. Another thing to remember is they are WEB based apps - they aren't available offline, they are tied to your Microsoft account, and you are probably at the mercy of the developer because you don't install them (Microsoft itself officially says \"An app for Office is basically a webpage that is hosted inside an Office client application\"). This means that if an app changes and you don't like it, well, you don't have a way to downgrade and can't use a saved installer for a previous version. The built in App panel\/manager viewer is pretty dinky too. You're better using your browser to get and manage apps.<br \/><br \/>==Overall==<br \/>Office 2013 is not an upgrade to 2010 (actually with everything I mentioned it is a downgrade). Visually, it has been changed without productivity in mind (not to being somewhat ugly), has questionable new defaults, and not any must have features. The removal or moving of certain features also makes it feel somewhat dumbed down. Only for people who really want the newest or extensively use Microsoft's Cloud.","Digital_Software"]}

{"features":["As a Mac user, I find GraphicConverter more useful for basic editing than Photoshop.  However, there are controls in Photoshop that are (not yet) available in GraphicConverter.  Downloading (if you have good bandwidth) is a good way to avoid the postage, pile of disks, etc. necessary from software bought on CDs or DVDs (it's clearly \"greener\").  Just be sure you make a back-up copy of the installer and put it in a different place, preferably off-site.<br \/><br \/>I also dislike the way the newer versions of Photoshop Elements give you some sort of general screen (which shows previous images, etc), then open a second piece of software, an editor, when you want to edit which, after all, IS THE ENTIRE REASON THE SOFTWARE EXISTS.  I dug through the files after installation and found the editor, which I open directly by placing its icon in the dock.<br \/><br \/>If you're into photo and image editing, you've more or less got to have Photoshop.

{"features":["First let me say that I have used both Turbo Tax and QuickBooks for years. The main reason that I use Turbo Tax is because it is SUPPOSED to import the data from QuickBooks and has done so in the past. For some reason, it would not import my data this year. I figured that should be an easy fix for Tech Support. Was I ever wrong!<br \/><br \/>Once I finally found a phone number that I could call I was eventually connected with a very pleasant young lady. She was very nice and pleasant but seemed to know very little about the product. She &#34;checked&#34; and said that others had been having the same issue. At this point she contacted her 2nd level support. Now things got painfully slow with her acting as a relay between me and this other level of support. She would ask me to do something, it wouldn't work, she would type back to her support person, 5 or 10 minutes later she would come back and have me try something else that didn't work. We did this for about an hour, trying the same couple of thing over and over getting the same error every time. All this time I was not allow to speak with anyone who knew what they were doing, just this person acting as a go-between.<br \/><br \/>Bottom line is that I had to enter all the information in by hand that TurboTax was supposed to pull from their own product, QuickBooks. I will NEVER be using TurboTax again! If I have to enter everything in myself, I might as well just use a better product like H&R Block tax software.","Digital_Software"]}

{"features":["Pixeljunk Shooter is a charmingly retro shoot-and-rescue game that makes ingenious use of the PS3's processing power to simulate fluids, gases, and ice. These materials interact with the world and the player's ship in a cartoonishly lifelike way, and often have to be used to get through a level. Water and lava will flow downhill, and collect in undrained areas. You can control it by shooting away sections of rock, or causing different materials to come into contact. For instance, lava, while dangerous to your ship, melts through ice. Water, when poured onto lava, will turn it into destructible dirt.  The controls are a joy. It's easy to steer the ship around, grab things with your grappling claw, and lay down fire with your main gun. There's also the option of guided missiles, but you must keep an eye on the all-important temperature gauge when you use them (as you must when flying near magma).  It's not a long game, but it's quite a pleasurable experience while it lasts. The artwork is colorful and quirky. The soundtrack, by High Frequency Bandwidth (including Alex Paterson of The Orb), is fantastic, adding a trippy chillout vibe that makes gameplay feel more relaxing than harrying.  The designers did a great job of mixing and matching different challenges in different areas, and there's always something new to keep you on your toes, including enemies, assorted devices to interact with, and temporary attachments that allow your ship to shoot out fluids or change the normal rules of physics. An experienced player can probably breeze through the whole game in a few hours, but there's added challenge in exploring hidden areas, collecting diamonds, and saving all the stranded astronauts (which includes not accidentally killing any).  If you like creative, old-school style games that take advantage of a modern game system's capabilities, this title is totally worth your money.","Digital_Video_Games"]}

In the museum, you get to an elevator and are essentially stuck.  The reason why is you have to fire a negative charge at the electric motor.  The problem?  You have to fire it with the middle mouse button, which is impossible if you have a laptop with a touchpad.  So, you have to go into the game's INI file and re-write the code to assign the Middle Mouse Button to another key (which took me forever to figure out how to do seeing as how there are three different INI files which feature the Middle Mouse Button).<br \/><br \/>2.  Steering while gliding in the demon challenge is impossible.  The game itself states that directional commands are used with &#34;W A S D&#34;, but they do nothing.  The arrow keys do nothing.  The only way to steer is by holding the mouse buttons and trying to swipe your fingers across the touchpad...all the while holding down the Space Bar and either a Left Control or &#34;V&#34; button.  It is the height of frustration to get through 20 percent of a game and to be confronted with a point through which you cannot progress due to poorly designed controls.<br \/><br \/>3.  Whatever you do, do not upgrade to &#34;Critical Strikes&#34;.  The skill wrecks the combat system.  After choosing the upgrade, Batman keeps swinging at walls while enemies are in the opposite direction.  The world's greatest detective is not blind, and it's a pathetic joke that you're in a combat scenario as Batman and attacking windowsills while thugs are ramming baseball bats into your head.","Digital_Video_Games"]}

So what does she do? She hires Flo and Quinn to be her stars and puts the show on BurgerTube.<br \/><br \/>I agree with the previous reviewer, the stations remind me a lot of Sally's Spa, but I have to say these are a little dumbed down. The point of the game is easy. You have a certain number of scenes you have to shoot each round. In order to do so, you have to get the actors on stage and in a good mood. You move the actors from station to station (hair, makeup, wardrobe, etc.) and sometimes bring them refreshments. If they get too mad, they stalk off and you can't do the scene, which invariably means you'll be doing the level over again. It's very fun and very entertaining. Just a few gripes.<br \/><br \/>First gripe is that the colors are so BOLD. That wouldn't be an issue, but skip the \"decorative lighting\" upgrade because they just blink all the time and make looking at the screen similar to staring at the sun. I also don't get the \"judging\" part. There are five \"judges\" who tell you how good or bad you did each level according to certain guidelines they give you at the start (serving drinks, winning mini games, etc.). You can use the points you earn here to unlock bonus levels. My gripe with this is, there's no checklist on the screen of these alternate goals while you're playing the level so unless you have a photographic memory chances are you aren't going to get all of them every level.<br \/><br \/>Overall I have to agree with the other reviewer. Soap Opera Dash is far superior to Fashion Dash, Dairy Dash, and Diaper Dash, but it's unfortunately not as fun as Cooking Dash or Hotel Dash.<br \/><br \/>Wish I could give it 3 1\/2.it's unfortunately not as fun as Cooking Dash or Hotel Dash.

{"features":["This is not a very enjoyable DLC to me. Hearthfire gives you three more options when it comes to owning a hold. Thing is, you build this hold FROM SCRATCH. You are given a plot  of land and from their, you collect the materials; wood, clay, iron, whatnot, and construct them into the smaller bits of a house then build from there. To me, it's very tedious and feels just like busy work. And in a game where you go about slaying DRAGONS and flinging magic with the push of a button, I'd want a little more than busy work in my DLC. Mind you, once you know what you want and have the money\/resources, you can make your hold however you want. But you'll need the money for those resources and additional time to build this home.<br \/>In addition, you're given the option to adopt a child from the streets or from the orphanage.<br \/>I've never done this. I will never do this. I bought Skyrim to roam the lands for adventure. Not baby sit a brat while I'm putting up the library wing of my house.<br \/>What's worse is that I was forced to buy this DLC 3 times; the first time when I bought Skyrim for Xbox 360, the second for PS3 (this purchase) and finally, I got it a 3rd time on PC just so I could access some of the mods available. I never tried using it on the Xbox cause I didn't know where I had to buy these plots of land and only saw my room mate use the DLC. I only recently was able to get into the meat of the DLC when I bought the PS3 copy... I'm kinda miffed that I've spent about 15-20 bucks total on 3 different purchases of this DLC.","Digital_Video_Games"]}

{"features":["It is not exactly a game, not in the traditional MMO sense- though there are plenty of things to get involved in. Second Life is one huge world wide community with something for just about everyone. About 95% of the world content is user created. There have been plenty of strange little documentaries made about SL that show its more degenerate side, but that is also true for a bunch of other online gaming as well. There is most certainly a seedy side to SL, and its not hard to find, but that is hardly what all of Second Life encompasses.<br \/><br \/>  In SL, if you can dream it, you can do it. Whether you are an artist trying to find your niche and explore a new medium, an explorer, or you just feel like checking out a different kind of social networking platform.<br \/><br \/>  There is a rough part - The world is constantly evolving because anyone can come in and build, script and create or perform. Games like GW2, Secret world, WOW etc run pretty smoothly where lag occurs in somewhat expected situations (Lots of people around major cities, raids etc)  In SL its a little different, the environment isn't static, things can change on the fly. Every avatar is different, the animations they use are different, the clothing they have is different - this is part of what makes SL so great but it is also what can cause issues- It just tends to be more demanding on your hardware than a static environment tends to be.<br \/><br \/>  A good jaunt through Flickr can show you some amazing possibilities of what SL has to offer. :)","Digital_Video_Games"]}
{"features":["Being an Alien fan myself meant I was pretty excited about this game when they finally gave it a release date. But after watching the hype Randy Pitchford made about this game before and playing this game after I doubt I'll take anything he says at face value ever again, which is a shame because gearbox made Borderlands 2, which I personally loved.<br \/><br \/>Most of the sound effects are very good and authentic to the movie. The acting is questionable at best but the sounds of the motion tracker, smart guns, pulse rifles and various other Alien universe items are iconic. Set designs in the game are pretty well crafted and feel authentic as far as layout and visual ambiance goes. They also threw a ton of fan service into the game. One of the first things you see is the lower half of Bishop's body from when he was torn in half by the Queen Xenomorph. Those parts about it were well done. Everything else I would expect in a decent quality shooter was omitted.<br \/><br \/>Apart from design the graphics are pretty terrible and all the textures are super low resolution (I was wondering why the game was only a 5GB download). One other reviewer mentioned the game looked like the original F.E.A.R. and they're exactly right. It looks like something that would have been released seven years ago. I would have expected them at least update the visuals somewhat for a title that was in development for 5 or so years.<br \/><br \/>The AI in this game is the most idiotic AI I've seen in a long, long time. It's OK for the first 20 minutes because xenomorphs jump on walls and stuff but it becomes an absolute bore after that. Xenomorphs and the enemy humans will run straight into your cross hairs and the game becomes a turkey shoot after awhile. The fact that they even move is about as good at these AIs get. At one point in the campaign a Xenomorph charged straight at me and just forgot I was there after I side stepped and got behind it. I didn't even shoot it after the fact and it just stood there, so I walked away and left it alone.<br \/><br \/>The campaign is surprisingly short. I beat it in 4 hours and I'm a pretty average FPS player. In no way is it worth $49.99 or $59.95 depending on the platform. It might be worth $19....might. Speaking of price I found it funny that you end up getting less for more because the graphics for the higher priced console versions are actually a lot worse than the PC version. I usually expect that but this game is so bad it brought that to my attention.<br \/><br \/>The multiplayer is pretty awful. As mentioned by others it's host driven so if they're disconnected that's it for that game. Ping rates are hit and miss because it depends on the host you're connected to. Player Marines vs Player Xenomorphs is really unbalanced favoring marines. Xenomorphs are pretty awkward to control and they die so easily no one wants to play on the xenomorph team. The only decent multiplayer mode is escape which models Left4Dead where you and up to 3 others have to get from the starting point on a map to the end point and survive but instead of zombies trying to murder you it's xenomorphs. That part was pretty enjoyable but unfortunately there are only two escape maps and they become boring really quick.<br \/><br \/>In the end this game has a few good quality points that get dragged all the way down by a lot of other bad points. I really wish they would have spent more time polishing it because it had potential to be really good. I'm giving it a 2nd star because there are some aspects of the game which are very authentic to the movie. If you're looking for an interactive museum of the Aliens movie this is your game,but if you're looking for a shooter that does more than barely pass the test you may be disappointed.<br \/><br \/>I would advise people not to buy this game because In Space, no one can hear you scream \"I spent sixty dollars on this?!\".","Digital_Video_Games"]}
{"features":["As a life-long fan of the sim city series, I was pretty excited to give Cities XL2012 a shot.  The first few hours are pretty entertaining, but the game doesn't seem to hold my attention after that.  I don't even mind the lack of real objectives or concrete goals, but the little annoyances keep adding up and over time make the game more trouble than it's worth.  Performance  This game really struggled on my older machine at population 100k, but I've recently started playing on my newer custom built (i7 2600k, 8 GB Ram, m7 SSD, GTX 570) and even after passing 1 million citizens it runs fine.  Graphics  Overall the graphics are pretty superb.  There are some nicely done little details here and there that catch you by surprise.  Once your city gets large though, you'll see the same building models repeated quite a lot.  Zoning  I appreciate the grid building tools that allow you to easily lay out rectangular or customizable patterns quickly.  That said, it's really annoying that switching between density levels results in varied grid sizes.  As a result, it's tough to place zones of varying density close to each other without seriously screwing up your road alignment.  I would also like to be able to switch to default road type that the zoning tools use.  Transportation  Road construction is nice overall, connecting somewhat complicated curvy roads is painless. That said, sometimes things that seem like they should work, simply don't.  \"Fast lanes\" (i.e., interstates) are also painful to use.  In particular, it's annoying that you cannot add an exit to an existing interstate.  You have to delete the entire road, build the exit, then re-build the road around it.  Traffic patterns around complicated interstate intersections also seem to get screwed up.  On the flip side, bus and subway construction is much more intuitive.  Utilities & Resources  This is one of the low points for me.  Most of the maps only have a small subset of the resources you need and even the ones they have are not sufficient for large cities.  I have a city of over 1 million and I think I have 10 or 12 of the largest power plants.  Perhaps it's time for a nuclear option?  Also, there's a lot of ambiguity here.  When trying to fulfill my city's waste needs, it's unclear to me how to balance junkyards vs landfills.  I have no idea how many power plants I need to build to fulfill an energy deficit of 4.  Oftentimes you end up having to trade.  This means you either have to build other cities, probably dedicated to the resources you need, or you can trade with omnicorp for absurd amounts of money.  Services (fire, health, safety)  I really like how this is done.  Each category has building of various capacity, and it shows you the reach of a given building before you actually construct it.  It's simple, it's effective.  Nicely done.  Services (education, leisure, hotels)  Now for the bad side of services.  Education is close to the above group, but there's some confusion.  You have access to schools for various ages.  Do I really need to provide 4 different levels of school coverage to every residential area?  I've done lots of testing and it's still unclear to me.  Leisure is even worse.  Why do I have to build bowling alleys and paintball places?  Shouldn't that be done for me in commercial zones?  The amount of time and effort it takes to fulfill people's need for leisure is extremely annoying and doesn't add any fun.  I would be onboard with some things (e.g., museums, theme parks, etc...) but the granularity here is crazy.  Likewise for hotels.  Really?  I have to build motels myself, to prevent commercial offices from failing?  Shouldn't these also be done automagically in commercial zones?  Overall I really wanted to love this game but it comes up short.  I do think this game, and its engine, has a lot of promise.  Hopefully another version arrives which fixes many of these issues, but in the meantime I'll keep my fingers crossed for Sim City 5.","Digital_Video_Games"]}

I tried replaying the game under a different player and the same thing happened.  Very frustrating!  I guess I could uninstall and start over, but good grief, I have run through the thing twice already and can't get to the end.","Digital_Video_Games"]}

{"features":["I've been waiting for the release of BF3 all year and sadly this game didn't live up to its reputation or the hype. The graphics and sounds effects are top notch, but the gameplay just doesn't hold up.  My first major complaint is with Battlelog. BF3 has no in-game menu, in order to launch the game you have to log into the Battlelog website and launch the game from there. So there is no way to change graphics settings, keybindings, etc... without first joining a game. The Battlelog server browser is also a joke, instead of retrieving the entire list of servers it only displays about 10-15 servers and then if you scroll to the bottom of the list it adds another 10-15 servers. The problem is that the first 10-15 servers populated are not necessarily the servers with the best ping, so you have to scroll to the very bottom of the list a few times in order to get a good selection of servers to pick from. Battlelog's only redeeming quality is that it gives you the ability to make squads, which allows you and your friends to join in the same game on the same team.  My second major complaint is with game stability and load times. In some cases it has taken me 10-15 minuntes just to get in the game. Most of the time it takes multiple attempts to join a server before I can actually get in. Sometimes the game crashes 2 or 3 times while loading, sometimes the game loads, but I get stuck on a black screen, and other times it actually works. I have three gaming computers and I have the same problem with all of them. Even when the game does load correctly it takes 3-4 minutes of waiting before you are finally able to play.   My final complaint is with lag in multiplayer. I own Battlefield 2, battlefield 2142, and Battlefield Bad Company 2 all of which play great online, however Battlefield 3 has taken a huge step backward in this area. You can be getting shot at, run behind a wall, and drop dead a second later even though you were no longer taking fire. I've also gotten kills on several occasions where I've run out of ammo while shooting at another player and it looks like they got away, but then a second later I get credit for shooting them, because of the lag. I've been playing online FPS's since Medal of Honor Allied Assault and I've never experienced lag online like this.  I'm very disappointed that my favorite PC title has turned out to be such a disaster so far, hopefully they can fix it with patches over the next several months. If the community stays around that long.","Digital_Video_Games"]}

(only 10 dollars at the time)<br \/><br \/>An \"expansion\" that adds close to nothing - and then punishing people who already bought the game by charging them extra for the ex-pac.<br \/><br \/>This game is nothing but a money sink - there is fun to be had but is it worth it?

Changing the limits of the cores won't do. It simply is no good. This game is full of bugs and Bethesda will not fix them. They already have Fallout 4 so they won't come back and deal with 3 in any of its editions. Watch out!

{"features":["Maxis said that the way Simcity was designed, persistent online is required because they do a lot of the computing power for you, making the game more robust, and I'll take them at their word.<br \/><br \/>But I still have a problem with EA shafting the users. Why? Because they not only charge $60 for the game, putting it in the same price range as massive games like Skyrim and Guild Wars, but they INTENTIONALLY sold the stripped-down version, requiring you to pay an extra $15 EACH for additional \"building packs\" that add nothing to the game and should have absolutely been included in the base product.<br \/><br \/>To buy the actual full game, the cost is $105. That's over a hundred dollars for a game with less scope than any SimCity game since the original release in 1989. I really hope Maxis can get out from under EA games and go back to making something worth buying.","Digital_Video_Games"]}

A briefly fun but ultimately frustrating experience.","Digital_Video_Games"]}
{"features":["The Spartans was a very unique game in many different ways, some good some bad.     First the good. Unlike most RTS based games every solider matters due to the fact it cost so much to train and arm a solider. A common trend such as in World Craft I find that strategy often fails, you generally just fend off intruders, raise a huge army and send all your forces to the enemies base, if you fail, you can always just raise another huge army and send them on their way.      What I really liked about this game was the wide array of weapons. You had the option of using different shields and weapons ranging in strength and range. Speed and range of a weapon made a huge difference. Some very strong weapons would allow you to carry a shield and other weapons. You had to mix your soldiers up with different weapons and just not the strongest weapon you can make.   Another interesting twist with your soldiers was that a solider did not just have to use a range or melee weapon, you could equip them with both which I have never seen before.    A big part of the fun of the game was basically designing different soldiers. Basically you can pick light, medium, and heavy armored unites, but yet you didn't have to give the best of weapons. Sometimes using the best shield wasn't needed. Each class of solider could handle any weapon, but the heavy unites (which moved at the same speed) would be the best suited to use a powerful two-handed weapon. In fact you could hold your strong troops in the back while using a shield and a range weapon, when the enemies force was weaken you could take your strong hitting units, but their range weapons away and clean the weaken enemies up, and drop back your soldiers that are about to die. Yet sometimes it made since to save money, and make cheap units with a two-handed range weapon and engage the enemy with medium to heavy armored units while your range weapon units stayed out of harms way.   Another brand new concept this game brought was that you could use your workers to gather your fallen shields and weapons so when creating solders it cost a fraction of the cost. In fact you could also pick up the weapons of your foes and give them to your own troops or even sell them.   What I also liked was that horses made a difference when it game to giving damage, of course the type of weapon you were using made a difference.   There was not such a thing as super weapons in the traditional sense. You could build charities however and upgrade them. Of course you always had the option of using upgraded or basic. However it wasn't smart to make more than two or three charities. Their main goal was to knock people down. It was too hard just to use a bunch of charities to knock your foes down. They were meant to give your soldiers a simple way to regroup and attack the fallen foes.      Second the Bad. When you start the campaign it looked like there was going to be around fourteen missions for both campaigns. All together there was only around 14, so the game was short.   Plus both campaigns were the same, there was nothing different about them. You were basically just had two different hero's and everything else was the same.    I found it disappointing that basically there was no point in making a castle. I personally like castle building and fending off the bad guys. Generally you head them off before they get to your base.     Another thing that bugged me was that once you got a new tech, it didn't mean you would always have it through out the game. While I was playing it I figured well okay I guess after mission seven everything will kick back in, but that was the last mission.     Also there are two stages where you have to use boats, but you could steel the foe's boat with a little ship that you put five soldiers on and grapple on and the boat become yours. The enemies' boats were never filled with soldiers.      In the previews you see elephants and other animals from two other factions. Not only don't you battlethe elephants but you cannot play with the two other factions, unless you set a special game up.      The three big kickers are....     The game is short   The two factions you play, as are the same   And you can't play the game online, unless you set up a LAN party.      In the End:     The game was fun, but the biggest disappointment in the game was that it could have been a great great game.","Digital_Video_Games"]}

Heroes VI is an average to mediocre game because of the sheer amount of filler stuffed into it.<br \/><br \/>The campaign maps are extremely large, however there is a severe lack of army variation because you can only recruit troops in your towns. You eventually end up upgrading your towns as fast as you can because the limiting factor in the game will be the troops available at the beginning of each week.<br \/><br \/>There are only two hero archetypes, mage and warrior with minor variation between campaigns. This only adds to the boredom as you will use the same tactics. Over and over.<br \/><br \/>While there are half-dozen mini-campaigns, they all play out in a very similar way.<br \/><br \/>I've finished 75% of the game but have hit a wall because of the tedium.","Digital_Video_Games"]}
{"features":["I used to play this when I was little, so playing it now is wonderfully nostalgic. I was nervous it wouldn't work on my new computer with Windows 8.1. At first, it didn't, but I ran it with compatibility mode for Windows XP and it worked. Sometimes it freezes up mid-game, which can get annoying, but I just remember to save frequently so nothing gets lost. Same deal now that I have Windows 10. Sometimes the game crashes, so remember to save and you'll be okay.   It's just like the first Rollercoaster Tycoon except it has some added features, scenery, rides, and parks. I think it's cool that it has actual Six Flags parks from around the world. It really is an awesome game. I wish they made more games like this today.","Digital_Video_Games"]}

You'll be repeating the same motif of &#34;run down this hall, shoot some guys in slow-mo, rinse, repeat for about 8 hours in single player.  Nothing is revolutionary about the game play, but it is very old school Max Payne, which I appreciated for about the first hour.  After that, you realize how stale that game play actually is these days.<br \/><br \/>The animations are great, the Euphoria engine is really well done in that regard.  The music is also very nicely done, and fit with the story well.  I got a real &#34;Man on Fire&#34; vibe from the whole game, which wasn't a bad thing.  The long, unskipable cutscenes, however, are pretty rough, and very prevalent.<br \/><br \/>All told, I had some fun with the game, and it was worth picking up on sale.  Multiplayer is practically non-existent, as it has no community any more, so I'd just get this for single player.","Digital_Video_Games"]}

{"features":["Okay I saw the debacle at launch but I love simcity and was waiting to buy this one.  When EA announced that they would be giving buyers a new game I decided to take the plunge.  I played for a couple of hours and had 0 issues logging in and playing.  The game is hard, but fair.  It's not like the old simcity where you can just bleed money and continue building,  here you have to be deliberate or it will cost you.  I didn't think I'd like the smaller city sizes or dealing with regions but now I get it.  This is the next evolution for simcity, overall the game is fun.  I gave it a four because I did notice it takes forever to get power and water working, not sure if that's a glitch or intentional.  Also that EA did royally screw up with the always on DRM and not being prepared for the server loads at launch. If you are on the fence about this game because of the negative publicity, my advice is to buy it you're going to have a good time.<br \/><br \/>Update 3\/12\/13<br \/>This game is broken, it is very disappointing that there are multiple flaws from traffic logic to emergency services.  The biggest flaw is that as your city gets more dense with population the game does not add multiple people from the building in to the workforce.  This means you will always have a shortage of workers.  I had about 100,000 people but only 9,000 were employed.  Maxis and EA have rushed this game and it shows, don't buy this until they fix the fundamental problems.  As good as the game is it's marred by these problems that anyone who plays the game for more than a few hours would see.  The developers rushed this and testing of this product just didn't occur.","Digital_Video_Games"]}

{"features":["This is not the first time I've sent a gift card from Amazon.com but it is not the first time that I've experienced difficulty using the card on the part if the giftee.  I had to put effort into making my purchases go against my gift card a few months ago and this time the recipient couldn't access it at all from his own computer.  I do not know what the final result has been in him dealing with customer service.<br \/>The cards are a great idea and very easy to send.  Now Amazon needs to figure out how to make them simpler to use.","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["it took three weeks for my gift card to arrive.  Long after the event for which it was sent for my grandchild's birthday.","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["Gift cards always appreciated","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["I ordered this for my daughter's birthday.  She doesn't have an Amazon.com account, and I thought that it would come in a print out version with a code number that would enable her to order some music for her MP3 player.  How wrong I was!  She needed my Amazon account password, and she is in a group home where I would have to give this password to the staff.<br \/>  She was very disappointed, and I will have to order something for her and send it to her.","Gift Card"]}

A week to little a little tin box with a card in it.<br \/><br \/>Now I get to wait and see whether the box is dented, scratched, etc.<br \/><br \/>Also get to wait and see whether the card has already been stolen (i.e., used) or whether it's usable.<br \/><br \/>It never never NEVER occurred to me that it would smart to check reviews for a (leaving out the adjectives here) GIFT CARD.<br \/><br \/>Amazon . . . bad.  These should be quick, and impeccable.  This should not be hard to do.","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["I use this because my family is not all local and not all in one place.  This is the perfect gift for everyone, every birthday, any where.  It's immediate delivery if you are a last minute shopper.  It allows the receiver to buy whatever they want.  I always get huge thanks every time I send one. Love this gift !","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["Excelente","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["Thanks, so fine, so fresh.","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["I enjoy giving gift cards so that the person can get exactly what they want rather than what I think they may want.  My biggest issue at this point is that I can't use PayPal to purchase them.  Trying not to use the credit cards and have at times just skipped the gift card and sent money through PayPal for a gift.","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["Works as expected.","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["Its exactly what is described as. A gift card that gets emailed to the recipient. My sister got hers in inbox at a decent time frame.","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["Did not get to recipient; had to reorder","Gift Card"]}

{"features":["Cute graphics and simple to make and send.  If you need to send &#34;the perfect gift&#34; quickly, this is it!  Nothing beats a more personal gift, obviously, but sometimes letting the receiver choose is a close second.","Gift Card"]}

{"features":["Our son-in-law is in the military and on special assignment so we sent him an I-Tunes gift card. He was so happy and it turned out to be the perfect gift because he lost his phone (which we did not know at the time) and when he got another one he needed to load all his music back on.  The gift card was easy to get through amazon and it arrived on time too.  He did have a Merry Christmas after all.","Gift Card"]}

{"features":["excelente","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["I really enjoyed using the gift card found so many things I wanted and needed it was used up really quick","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["Despite being ordered several days before the delivery date, it was not emailed on time.  Additionally, when I tried to re-send the gift card, it still took several days for the recipient to receive it.  REALLY disappointed.","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["It came instantly after I ordered it","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["Needed it, they had it now I got it","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["This seems hard to mess up, and a few commenters have mentioned it, but mine also came in a pretty badly damaged box. It just looks really bad when you are sending a gift and it arrives all dented and messed up. At that point, why even bother.","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["The gift card I recently redeemed was a Christmas gift from my Mother-In-Law.  She lives hundreds of miles from me and it's much easier to get the gift card than ship a gift.  It is a simple, quick, easy way to handle a holiday gift and you get to purchase what you really want instead of the giver trying to guess what you want or need.","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["just love sending these...so fast and efficient. and welcome by those who receive.","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["I like that you can give someone a gift card through Facebook, and Amazon remembers to post it at the right time. I bought this months ahead and it was delivered correctly, no problem!","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["With my Amazon gift card, I was able to get a variety of great items including clothes, electronics, books, shampoo, presents, and more...it's the only gift I want during the holidays or for my birthday!","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["Not a real problem...got caught up in the much publicized Christmas rush.  But what ticked me off most is the tracking info said it had been delivered, giving a day and time.  This made me think maybe some one had stolen it from my doorstep.  Fortunately, it had not...it arrived the next day.  Lesson learned:  Forget the nice box, have gift cards emailed.","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["excellent","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["The picture we chose for the Gift Card of all the available options did not print.  The cover only had the Amazon &#34;a&#34; logo.","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["had a short but cute message!","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["I had several (3) $100 VISA gift cards that I wanted to apply to a single Amazon purchase.  It turned out that the easy way to do this was to buy 3 Amazon gift cards, delivered by email, and then apply them to my Amazon account and then to my purchase when I checked out.  The only way it could have been easier would have been if there were something in the FAQs that suggested doing it that way, but it didn't take long to figure it out.","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["Bad","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["Thanks a lot","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["It's a great gift to give because the recipient can buy what they rea;;u want with a great selection to choose from.","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["I got these on a sale that came with a free $10 gift card for buying. We are always spending money on amazon so this was great. Spent all $55 within the first week. Would definitely do again when they run a promotion or if we need gifts to send to people.","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["The tin had a dent and was embarrassed to gift it that way to a newly wedded couple.","Gift Card"]}

{"features":["I love Amazon gift cards!","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["What's that?","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["A very Christian and &#34;proper&#34; romance. I downloaded it because I love Skye. Both the writing and the romance was a bit dull.","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["While at first I had trouble adjusting to Titus Welliver as Bosch because he didn't match the mental image of Bosch I've developed over the years (Welliver's Bosch is a bit more alpha-male than the image I'd formed) it didn't take long before I was interested in the show.  Top-notch production values and a great cast of actors combined to build a great foundation for a series with longer plot arcs than a typcial procedural in which the crime, case-building, capture, and court case are squeezed into 45 minutes.  I'll check out some of the other Amazon Originals, but this one will be hard to beat, coming from a Michael Connelly fans such as myself.","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["The was absolutely the easiest gift card I ever bought.  It was very well received and appreciated by the recipient.","Gift Card"]}

{"features":["Great way to give a gift or to help keep your spending habits in check. Lol. Keeps the hubby happy.","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["This Amazon Christmas gift card was a last minute fall back gift - but it worked great - allowing me to customize the card picture, the message, and the arrived as a printable PDF with fold and cut-lines making the process so easy that I might not buy another physical gift card in the future.  I wish I could purchase and print greeting cards and envelopes this way!","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["Easy to use - don't have to go out in bad and\/or cold weather.  Can buy several books and read when I get the time.  Like to set aside the time on certain evenings for reading and make sure I keep that reading appointment!  No commercials!","Gift Card"]}

{"features":["A mistake could not be changed.  I clicked on the wrong choice and the gift card was sent to me.  I called and it took multiple times to get to a person.  I was then told this could not be changed and after a significant time the called ended.  I had to include an explanation with the print out.  I was told that he could use the gift card with the certificate number.  It was a disappointment.","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["This birthday card was never delivered as I requested and the gift card was not  delivered until I made a phone call after talking to my daughter when I learned her birthday gift had not arrived. My gift was therefore late. I am very disappointed in this on line service.","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["Very easy and great selection . Best way to send a gift card and easy to set up and send thru your Amazon account.","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["Sent it twice to the correct email address. Apparently it never arrived - not in the inbox nor spam nor trash. He kept an eye out for a week or two and we used a second email. Kind of ruined the surprise and he got his gift several weeks later than I was hoping. I do not think I will use the email gift cards again - not for a while anyway.","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["IT was quick and easy to do. I had an issue with wrong e-mail address to the party I sent it to and it was corrected and resent.<br \/>Thank you","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["I received an Amazon Gift Card for mothers day and it was so easy to use. I went to my amazon account and clicked on apply gift card to my account. It was so easy.

{"features":["It's a gift card for Amazon that shows a nativity scene and is in a nice little box.  What more can be said?  It's for Amazon so it's great.  The box itself is nice and the bow wasn't smashed by the shipping package.","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["I run a book blog so I often host giveaways for my followers.. I enjoy the convenience of Amazon GC; my one and only complain is that I'm not able to use the credits (gift cards) I receive from your affiliate program to purchase GC's for this purpose. As a result, I probably won't be purchasing GCs again in the future.","Gift Card"]}

{"features":["I thought this was a fun idea.  They had a few videos you could choose from.  When it said upload a video, I though you could upload your own video.  I wanted to video my kids singing Merry Christmas to their Grandma.  Then I realized you could only upload choices that Amazon gave you.  If they can change it so you can upload your own video, that would be great!","Gift Card"]}

{"features":["I wanted to send a monetary Gift card to a friend in the UK.<br \/>All went well until he received notice and tried to retrieve it. Mind you, I was charged as if I had purchased an item for delivery.<br \/>He was unable to retrieve it as Amazon UK and Amazon USA are separate, and therefore he could not get his gift.<br \/>No warning before hand, nothing.<br \/>I called Amazon and they explained that there was nothing they could do.<br \/>I had to go through the entire process of return and get credit..<br \/><br \/>That's my story<br \/>Fred Auebach","Gift Card"]}

{"features":["Bought this email gift card online over a week before my brother in laws birthday....was delivered two and a half weeks later. REALLY disappointed and still wonder why with nothing to do but deliver to his email it was delayed so long. Called Amazon about an answer for why but STILL have yet to hear anything. Became one of their VISA cardmembers a couple of months ago and seriously thinking about going with another since I won't be buying any more gift cards from AMAZON anymore.","Gift Card"]}

{"features":["The perfect gift for a true Amazon, Labrador lover, and heavy duty shopper! Thanks amazon for making these possible. If I could make a suggestion, there were some cards on the site that were actual cards, which I would have liked to have email sent, but that option was not available. So, perhaps in the future, you can make the hard cards available as email cards as well. Thanks again Amazon!","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["My sister loved the card.","Gift Card"]}
{"features":["Its a gift card, so it'll \"work.\"  I would like to suggest that Amazon offer a gift card template that allows us to insert our own photographs?  On the whole, the gift card options available are rather boring and limited, Amazon has fallen behind the marketing curve in this area.","Gift Card"]}
