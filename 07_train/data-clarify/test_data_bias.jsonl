{"features":["Bought this because it came in a package with Turbo Tax and was a pretty nice deal.<br \/><br \/>Overall, the product does not provide me what I wanted it to.  I wanted a tool that would show my total net worth while also tracking my upcoming cash flow and spending habits WITHOUT need a lot of manual intervention.  Fyi, I bought this for personal use.<br \/><br \/>Cons:<br \/><br \/>It has problems syncing two of my 401k accounts, does not know when my CC bills are due so I can't see the cash flow change in the calendar view, can't sync my car loan, and the home value \/ mortgage data is off because I refinanced.  Many expenses are mis-categorized (example: you buy gas from a grocery store on the store's CC, it considers all those transactions groceries and not gas).  Adding things like car value and your home are very tedious.  Any sort of check you've written (example for church or because you owed a friend) need manual categorizing.<br \/><br \/>Pros:<br \/><br \/>If you are willing to spend a TON of time customizing everything, you will get a nice view of your assets, liabilities, long term debt, cash flow, and expenses.  If you an easy way to manage all your money... this product is most hassle than it's worth.<br \/><br \/>Overall:<br \/><br \/>After spending about 4 hours setting the software up, I have yet to revisit the software and will probably go back to tracking everything by spreadsheet like I always have.","Digital_Software"],"star_rating":2}

{"features":["I have been a longtime user of Pinnacle Studio, dataing back to version 9 and even earlier.<br \/>It has been somewhat of a love \/ hate relationship, as I love what the software can do in terms of editing, effects, etc., but it has caused many headaches, with lockups and other bugs, usually when I am on a tight schedule trying to finish a project.  And it seems rather than Pinnacle providing fixes and patches to stabilize a particular version of Studio, such as version 15, which I am still actively using, they seem to just introduce a newer version, i.e. Studio 16, and now Studio 17, and then not provide much support for the older versions, hoping that an upgrade to the newer version will fix  all problems.  But, in many cases, the upgrade introduces new problems, sometimes causing compatibility issues with older projects, sometimes breaking specific plugins, or previously purchased effects and sound libraries.  And often, introducing significant changes in the user interface, causing a significant learning curve often often right in the middle of an existing project that you just want to get done, without having to learn how to use the software all over again.<br \/><br \/>Anyway, here I am once again considering an upgrade to the latest Pinnacle Studio 17, as the sale price is very attractive.  But, I find it hard to believe that with the very large customer base of Pinnacle users out there, that there are only two reviews for Pinnacle 17 on Amazon, one good, and one bad.  And the bad review doesn't really provide much detail about the lockups, such as version of Windows, etc.<br \/><br \/>So, it would be nice to see some reviews from more than just two users.  I'm sure Pinnacle has sold more than 2 copies of Pinnacle Studio 17 so far.  So, it would be great to see more reviews based on people's experiences, especially those that have upgraded from older versions and can comment on the stability, learning curve based on changes in user interface, etc.<br \/>So, treat this as a request for more reviews on the latest version of Pinnacle Studio.","Digital_Software"],"star_rating":3}

I can't download 401K or IRA information from either but I can download statements in iBank4 that I can't with Quicken. I also like that I can import statements to iBank4.\/ Because my laptop is barely working I didn't try to import Quicken to iBank..hmm, so iBank4 wins.

{"features":["Bought Quicken 2012 Premier in Jan 2012 to upgrade my 2011 version and prepare for tax season.  During the installation, Quicken downloaded updates which locked up my plain vanilla Win7 PC.  I can count on one hand the number of times that has happened in the two years I've used Win7.  I let it sit, locked, for 10 minutes.  Finally, it resolved itself.  If the program was doing something, why didn't I get a window saying that?  That hurdle cleared, I started using the program.  The first time I tried to download historical stock prices, which 2011 did in about 5 seconds, 2012 ran on for several minutes.  I thought it was locked up.  But, again, I waited and it finally cleared itself.  OK, so maybe it needed to do that just once to catch up.  Still does it infrequently now with no apparent logic.  I see in Help\/About that Quicken 2012 is already (Jan 2012) on \"R4\" which means 4th revision - after how many weeks on the market?  If you have a burning desire to be an early adopter, try to restrain yourself for a few months.  By then Quicken's users will have worked out the major bugs.  Lousy Quality Control.  I have been a long term user of Quicken dating back to the DOS days.  I defected to MS Money a few years ago because of frustration with Quicken bugs - until MS abandoned the program.  Money was a superior program, quality wise.  I rely on Quicken heavily for investment info and in keeping accurate records.  2011 had an annoying bug where when I downloaded stock transactions from my broker before the market closed (Scottrade), it would give me bad numbers on historical security prices for the rest of the day. The next day it would be fine but it would never correct the prior day's stock prices - messing up history and daily trading decisions. This appears to have been fixed in 2012.  I can't figure out what Intuit is trying to do by putting out buggy software to the most popular money management software on the planet.  Even the behemoth MS puts out higher qualitysoftware.  Are they trying to force us to the web version?  Is that buggy too?  Personally, I don't like having account data on the web.  Too many eyes on it and prone to attacks by hackers.  So, will continue to use Quicken or a viable competitor on my PC.  My message is to wait to buy Quicken 2012 and to Intuit, FIX YOUR QC PROBLEMS!  I hope someone at Intuit is reading these reviews.

Sure enough, after the cutoff date, I couldn't download transactions directly from my financial institutions anymore.  I kind of feel like they were holding me hostage, forcing me to pay another $35 or so to keep the convenience of being able to download.  Its kind of a crappy thing to do.  They shouldn't disable features and services that work perfectly fine on software.  The fact of the matter is that Quicken 2012 offers NOTHING for me and the way I use the software that my Quicken 2009 didn't do.  I wouldn't have upgraded otherwise, I wouldn't have needed to.  But here I was, held hostage and I figure in 3 years they'll probably pull the same stunt again.  If they do, I might start to look at what other options are out there because money management software has come a long way since Quicken was the innovator in personal finance software.<br \/><br \/>So I get this thing installed and that was fine but guess what?  None of the financial institution downloads would work.  So the very thing that I bought it for was the very thing that wasn't working.  I contacted customer support, and the guy couldn't figure it out so he had me email logs and such and said someone would get back to me in 7 - 10 business days.  After 3 weeks I still hadn't heard anything so I emailed back twice more.  Finally I got a solution to the problem (turns out it was a very quick and simple fix that the first guy should have been able to address).  So I'm glad they solved my problem but the hoops I jumped through with their service made me a little unhappy.  Still, its always been generally reliable software that usually works as it should, so as long as nothing else breaks on it, I guess I'll be a happy camper.<br \/><br \/>Anyway, this may be a great thing for you or you might find alternatives that are just as good or better.

{"features":["I used Quicken in the past with great success. I use Quickbooks at work. This version is slow and has some frustrating quirks. Importing transactions is fast from the internet but it can easily duplicate these transactions if you enter any by hand. An annoying bubble pops up when your mouse rolls over certain fields that locks the screen for at least three seconds. You cannot turn it off. You have to click two to three times somewhere else to close it. It has no &#34;X&#34; in the corner to close it. Quicken forums is full of haters of this more than anything.<br \/>The bulk of the program and the reports are great as usual. Intuit continues to try to make a program that learns and is intuitive. This is where they create things that don't always work out and you can't turn these off.<br \/>I needed this program so it is useful ultimately. That being said, I am not as happy with it as in prior iterations.","Digital_Software"],"star_rating":3}

{"features":["Quicken 2015 is a sad and shallow shadow of its 2007 predecessor.  About the only thing it can do is keep my checkbook register--and it doesn't do as well even in that simple task.      Gone is the seamless double entry bookkeeping that automatically records debit-and-credit transactions simultaneously in different accounts, retaining necessary identifying information in both entries (the simple term \"Transfer\" is not sufficient).  Gone is the ability to customize reports by category and\/or account and\/or any field you liked!  Reconciling was easy in Q-2007.  In Q-2015, it's sluggish, and there seems to be no history of previous reconciliations.  There's no \"unmark all\" function.  Therefore, if you need to recheck your register against your bank statement, you either have to tediously unmark each transaction or mark all transactions that predate the opening date of the reconciliation as \"reconciled.\"  This defeats the advantage of reconciliation in tracking belated transactions!    Oh, yes--there are no graphs anymore!  I relied on them to quickly track progress and\/or regress in my accounts.    The register view is another disappointment.  In Q-2007, I could set up a formula that automatically added sales tax to a transaction.  It's not in Q-2015.  Why not?  If it sounds as though I'm only listing the things that Q-2015 can NOT do compared with Q-2007, I can only hope that Intuit will pay heed and give us a version of a serious personal finance program.  There's really nothing else available, unless you are satisfied with merely maintaining your checkbook register.    Until Intuit decides to do that, I am going to try to run Quicken for Windows via Parallels.    I HATE having to do this.  If I had wanted to run Windows programs, I would have not invested in Mac's over the last 31 years.    I have been a MacQuicken user since before 1997, and a TurboTax user since the program was first published for Mac's.  I was concerned when Intuit informed Mac users that MacQuicken 2007 would not work with the OS Lion system Apple introduced in 2011.  Intuit shortly introduced Mac Essentials as an alternative.  \"Essentials\" was awful!  (see my review under that product).  So I tied myself to the outdated Apple OS that would run Quicken 2007.  I was delighted a couple of weeks ago to learn that Intuit had finally come to our aid with Quicken for Mac 2015.  At last I could have it all--a modernized OS on my Mac, plus a truly functional personal finance program.  Refer to my headline at this point.    C'mon, Intuit!  Have respect for your Mac customer base!","Digital_Software"],"star_rating":2}

It forces you to upgrade every three years or so to continue getting statement download support and over the years the improvement in the product has been minimal and uneven. Honestly at the point the product is a mess and needs substantial rethinking. They need to take a page from Microsoft (I can't believe I'm saying that) and stop just adding random features to justify upgrades but make the whole product more coherent. (Take a look at what Microsoft has been doing with Office (especially Outlook and OneNote) which are actually great to use right now.<br \/><br \/>I'll give you an example. Budgeting is a complete mess. It has a budget view (which is now on the planning tab), which is different than the budgeting view you get from reports, which is different still than the view you get from the iPad. Why are there three different views that basically give you the same information?<br \/><br \/>They also moved the budget editing into the budget view itself. Which is better in some ways (much easier to change a particular line item while looking at your actual budget values) but worse in others (changing a line item requires you to apply that change to just this month, previous months, later months) etc. It's easy to make mistakes depending on when you decide to update your budget that my yearly budget is now different depending on what month you look at and I've given us trying to reconcile it.<br \/><br \/>Which is kind of typical of Quicken. There are a million features in Quicken but they are hard to use. Quicken wants to be something for everyone and as a result is a bit of an incoherent mess. So why the three stars. Well, it still tracks all my finances and allows me to look at my budget and I do like the iPad app. (Make a windows phone app please.)<br \/><br \/>But honestly, make something a lot moreusable or for the first time in 20 years I'm going to seriously look for an alternative.<br \/><br \/>By the way, this is the buggiest version of Quicken I've ever used.

Intuit used this tactic in 90's to remove features, put them in higher end products and then call attention to the new features.

{"features":["I'll be posting this same review for both the TurboTax Deluxe and H&R Block Deluxe products.  Like many people I was upset about the changes to the Turbo Tax software but I had already purchased it, then I found out that H&R Block was offering a free download of their sofware to Turbo Tax customers, so I wrote to them and sure enough they gave me a free download, figured I'd give it a shot.  I completed my taxes in H&R Block and found that the software was clunky and was not user friendly, the questions were asked in a confusing manner that on multiple occasions left me less than confident of the answers.  At this point I should clarify that I have often filled out my taxes long form by hand, majored in finance in college, and actually used to volunteer to do taxes for low income people...so I can say with confidence I generally know what I'm doing with taxes, and to be left dumbfounded on so many of these questions seemed odd to me.  On one question I tried the H&R Block chat function, it took 45 minutes to get somebody on the chat, and once I got the guy he didn't actually know anything about the tax form, however I will note that they do TECHNICALLY have people available 24 hours a day unlike TurboTax which only runs until 9pm PST during tax season.  So I wrapped up my taxes but I just couldn't shake the feeling that my form wasn't accurate.  After thinking it over I decided to bite the bullet and open up TurboTax rather than returning it.  The interview process was easy to use as I've come to expect over the years.  Also, for some reason, TurboTax ended up getting me a couple hundred dollars more for my return, which I don't really understand since its all pretty simple math, so I went to the forms and it turns out TurboTax had asked about a few more deductions like car registration fees which H&R Block didn't ask about.  In the end I continue to be very happy with TurboTax and when it really comes down to it I didn't even need the extra forms that had been removed, but I still think it was pretty crappy of them to remove them.","Digital_Software"],"star_rating":1}

I figured that should be an easy fix for Tech Support. Was I ever wrong!<br \/><br \/>Once I finally found a phone number that I could call I was eventually connected with a very pleasant young lady. She was very nice and pleasant but seemed to know very little about the product. She &#34;checked&#34; and said that others had been having the same issue. At this point she contacted her 2nd level support. Now things got painfully slow with her acting as a relay between me and this other level of support. She would ask me to do something, it wouldn't work, she would type back to her support person, 5 or 10 minutes later she would come back and have me try something else that didn't work. We did this for about an hour, trying the same couple of thing over and over getting the same error every time. All this time I was not allow to speak with anyone who knew what they were doing, just this person acting as a go-between.<br \/><br \/>Bottom line is that I had to enter all the information in by hand that TurboTax was supposed to pull from their own product, QuickBooks.

{"features":["First, the down load is huge AND slow. You will be down loading 5GB+ of files and I experienced to bad files that required downloading again. The install also was very slow. Logging in and registering is confusing, and also very slow process. The online help takes you to a empty wiki. Don't look for help there, or the manual for that matter. Like others who commented, it has very little real helpful information. This simulator is very unintuitive. The tutorial covers very limited functionality, and nothing on the surveyor mode. Learning curve is VERY steep to do more than play with the program.<br \/><br \/>If you are purchasing this simulator expecting to load railroads all over the world, or at least your country, any country that is... You are going to be disappointed. The basic download has little to know areas to operate. The content manager allows you to down load user designed areas, vehicles, buildings, consists, etc. I have a 5 to 7 MB connection to everywhere but Auran's servers. That fastest download I saw was 24KB with frequent failures.<br \/><br \/>The trains, consists and some of the terrain features look very good, but the visual engine is horrible. I have a i5 core, 6GB Ram, 250GB SSD, x560 video card. OS is windows7. The video often skips frames, or freezes for 5 to 10 seconds at a time. I can constantly see terrain building in sections in front of the terrain. I started out with the OpenGL video choice. Changing it to DirectX 10 improved performance slightly. Like I said. The game engine seems to be from early 2000s. The world and train sounds are horrendous. River or creeks sound like a toilet leaking. The sound engine is terrible at best.<br \/><br \/>If you are looking for a antiquated simulator with quirky visuals, and have a few dozen hours to learn how to use the simulator and builder; this is for you. If you just want to load a simulator and enjoy realistic terrain; you would be better off looking elsewhere.","Digital_Video_Games"],"star_rating":2}
{"features":["I was pleasantly surprised by this game.  It is a traditional HOG - each level has certain places to visit on each level and lists of items to find in each place.  Since I've played a lot of these by now, I thought I would be rather bored (read my review on Margrave Manor 2), but I wasn't.  The lists of objects included \"description\" names which, albeit nothing new, I thought were particularly well done in this game.  It also had some interesting \"hint\" tools on each level that you could purchase with points earned from previous play (like a painter's palette that, once activated, turns your item list from words to pictures).  It also gave bonus points for finding objects in quick succession, which I happen to like.  I also thought the graphics were very good.  Some of the objects were hard to find, but the hint system worked well.  If what you really want is a traditional HOG game, I would check out the free trial.  Some warnings: (1) It is very short.  I didn't time myself, but I don't think it took more than a couple of hours.  (If playing the free trial, keep in mind that it only has eleven levels).  (2) This is the first installment.  It ends abruptly in a cliffhanger so that you will buy the second installment.  (3) I thought that the main voice-over was terrible as far as acting is concerned.  Or maybe the main character (whose husband has just vanished, and she is being lead by a ghost to find him) is supposed to be that way.","Digital_Video_Games"],"star_rating":4}

{"features":["BioShock Infinite is the third installment in the series of games which began with 2007's much-acclaimed BioShock.  While the game has some similarities to the earlier games of the series, Infinite is quite different in other areas which are sure to make some fans rankle.  Overall I found it an entertaining, if somewhat flawed game.  To explain why, I will start with the \"cons\", since that seems to be what most people are interested in when reading reviews, and then I will follow with what I think worked rather well in Infinite.<br \/><br \/>SPOILERS!  -- THERE WILL BE SPOILERS HERE -- DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE EXPOSED TO SPOILERS! -- SPOILERS!<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/><br \/>1.  Combat System.  The combat system has been substantially simplified in many areas.<br \/><br \/>First, the player is limited to carrying only two weapons.  This appears intended to require more tradeoffs to be made by the player, but can feel like an irritating limitation as compared with the previous games.  It can also discourage upgrading too many weapons, because the player will most likely have one \"keeper\" weapon and one \"off\" weapon using this system, which tends to make the game play very similarly over the course of the game.<br \/><br \/>Second, the setting of the game features mostly wide open areas, unlike the cramped conditions of Rapture from the earlier games.  This makes the gameplay much easier as a practical matter, and much more typical of a generic shooter type game.<br \/><br \/>Third, the game lacks truly challenging enemies like the first two games had.  No enemy here is really like a Big Daddy in difficulty or challenge, and even the tougher enemies (patriots, handymen, firemen, ravens) are really not very tough to beat in terms of requiring significant tactical thought and adjustment.<br \/><br \/>2.  Linear design.  Unlike the earlier games, where the player could move around the entire map freely, exploring or collecting resources and the like, Infinite is a linear experience where the player progresses through areas that are then closed.  These can be reloaded from a chapter menu, but that is simply \"replaying a zone\" -- it isn't exploring a city organically as was the case with the earlier games.  This serves the narrative, but tends to make Infinite feel more \"gamey\" than the earlier titles in a forced way.<br \/><br \/>3.  Story Problems.  SPOIILER!-- SPOILER! -- SPOILER!  Here there will be a lot of disagreement among the playerbase.<br \/><br \/>The storyline essentially revolves around Ken Levine's narrative gloss on the theoretical physics theory of the multiverse.  Some players will find this irritatingly similar to films like Inception, and others will just find it confusing.<br \/><br \/>The issue I have with it is that it kind of plays lip service to some of these theoretical physics ideas (multiverse theory), and makes various hand-waves at quantum physics throughout the game (some of which are bound to go over most players' heads, but that's a separate problem), but then violates these ideas in substantial and problematic ways without explanation.  For example, it is a known time travel paradox that one cannot travel back in time because doing so will compromise one's contemporary existence -- this is even more the case where one is going back in time to kill oneself, or precisely to allow oneself to be killed, by one's offspring --> this is an impossible paradox, because if you kill yourself at an earlier period, you would never exist to come back in time and kill yourself to begin with.  It's a paradoxical loop, which is one reason why physicists have been skeptical of time-travel.  Now, time-travel is fine in a setting where the plot is fantasia and soft and so on, but if you are throwing in references to quantum mechanics and string theory and so on throughout the game, playing fast and loose with some of the ideas feels, well, snarky.<br \/><br \/>A similar issue is raised with respect to the entire treatment of multiple universes in the game.  The multiverse theory, which is more speculation than hard science anyway but is still a theory floated by theoretical physicists, posits that there are infinite universes.  This means that, in theory, there are infinite versions of you, and infinite possibilities for how your life plays out in an infinite number of universes.  The game's name itself is a reference to this theory.  But the multiverse theory also implies that no *one* universe is dispositive of what happens in the others -- there is no \"core reality\" from which the rest of the possibilities emerge.  There is simply an infinite number of parallel realities.  This is problematic for the game, where clearly the suggestion is that the drowning of the player's character in the game dispositively removes all instances of the game's main antagonist in all possible universes -- something which doesn't make sense per the actual theory of the multiverse.  Instead, the \"game's theory\" appears to be that there is a core reality which is determinitive of other possibilities -- which is a nice theory, but it isn't the multiverse, and it isn't explained in the game, either.  Now, I realize that this is a video game and not a physics textbook, and that therefore the narrative should be more important than the science.  That's true.  But, again, if it's just a case of \"making stuff up\" in a nice way to serve a narrative purpose, then the game ought not do so much hand-waving and term dropping from *actual* quantum physics -- this just comes across as intellectually snarky.<br \/><br \/>Clearly the game and its ending were designed to cause controversy, and thereby generate attention.  That has been a success.  Upon further review, however, the ending becomes more problematic, even if taken from a purely narrative point of view.  Paradoxes are fine, but raising *known* paradoxes and not addressing them at all feels ... sloppy.<br \/><br \/>4.  No Manual Saves.  I realize that this is a point of contention in the player community, some of which seems convinced that the ability to save anywhere outside combat is game breaking.  However, the problem with Infinite is that the automatic save points are very spread out.  It's not uncommon for a player who likes to explore to lose 15-30 minutes of game time if they need to quit the game on short notice -- as is not uncommon for people who are fairly busy.  This is a very unfortunate design for a game like this one, and really should be changed in a patch.<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/><br \/>1.  Fun game world.  As noted above, this isn't Rapture, it's Columbia.  Rapture probably had more personality, and was certainly creepier, while Columbia is airier and more subservient to the overall narrative.  Columbia here is a backdrop, whereas Rapture was a character.  But ... it's an entertaining backdrop and filled with fun details.<br \/><br \/>2.  Interesting switch-back themes.  While it was thought prior to Infinite's release that the game would mostly be a pointed criticism of right-wing American mytholog(ies), in reality it is more the case that the game whipsaws themes around in an interesting way.  Thus while it's true that the initial portrayal of Columbia as a racist, fundamentalist bubble that worships the founders of the US is an easy and over the top take on something most people already see as false, this theme is not a main one in the game.  In subsequent chapters the game takes the freedom fighters (whom the player probably identifies as \"good guys\" as compared with the racist fundamentalists of the game's early chapters) and turns them into vicious violent killers which it explicitly says are just as bad as the racists.  This challenges assumptions which the player had probably already internalized about them by then, which creates discomfort -- that is well done.  The game also portrays the scientist couple -- which one would \"normally\" see as the foil to the fundamentalist zealots -- and makes them morally ambiguous at best, portraying them as almost amoral and more or less powerless to stop, if not downright helping, the fundamentalists.  And, finally, the game takes the female character, Elizabeth, and kind of toys with whether she will be a love interest for the player character before revealing that she, or a previous version of her, was his daughter (in this or another universe, apparently), which, again, challenges assumptions.  The way that these themes cascade to challenge assumptions is fairly well done in the plotting.<br \/><br \/>3.  Some fun fight sequences, like the rail fights (which are not spectacular by any means, but fun) helped make the combat, which is overall fairly lackluster, a bit more interesting at times.<br \/><br \/>=======<br \/><br \/>Summary (TL;DR):<br \/><br \/>Infinite is a good, but not great, game characterized by a good narrative which nevertheless plays fast and loose with theoretical physics and average shooter style combat which is occasionally livened up in a few sequences.  It's fun to play and I found it enjoyable, but I think that the \"it's the best game ever!\" type of breathless reviews it is is getting miss the mark by overlooking some aspects of the game that are less than stellar or simply problematic.f contention in the player community, some of which seems convinced that the ability to save anywhere outside combat is game breaking.

{"features":["The good news is that this game ran perfectly on PC and never crashed or had any bugs. The load time was a bit long, but worth it. X-Box wireless controller for PC worked perfectly. Also, If you are a fan of the Hitman series (as I am) I do recommend that you play this one. It's not bad and It will deliver what it should. Now my complaints:<br \/><br \/>First, the developers were pretty lazy this time around in my opinion. I feel like a lot of the game graphics and costumes were just recycled from Blood Money (such as that huge oversized crate for hiding bodies... when are they going to update that?). But, unlike the rest of the series, when you holster your weapons they just magically fade away. This also means you can hide a sniper rifle in your coat, but this is a huge deviation from the original series that did not allow you to conceal long guns.<br \/><br \/>Second, frequently this game is not fun. The reason is because some stages have a large number of enemies, and the disguises are pretty useless (unlike the rest of the series). The previous games in the series allowed you to sneak around a bit more to survey the situation and decide what you wanted to do.  But, Absolution often has a guard standing on every corner in some stages.<br \/><br \/>Third, the storyline was lazy. For most of the game the story has you are either running away from enemies, or chasing them from stage to stage. There is no deep plot. Considering this is a Square-Enix game, and a Hitman title, I was expecting more effort to make a deeper plot line.<br \/><br \/>Finally, I feel the Designers were lazy by NOT allowing you to select your guns at the start of each mission. That was one of the best parts of the earlier games.","Digital_Video_Games"],"star_rating":3}

{"features":["I do not understand any of the criticisms here. Are people out there seriously expecting another full game? This should be rated for what it is, an expansion to Bioshock Infinite. The game promised to bring us back to rapture with the Infinite gameplay and ties to both games and that is exactly what it does. It finds a way in the story to connect both worlds and act as a sequel to Infinite and a prelude to Bioshock. Am I the only one who realizes how genius irrational must be to pull that off? They also find a way for us to have the familiar Bioshock enemies (splicers) for us to fight even before the fall of rapture. The fact that you are fighting splicers and not humans who care for their self preservation this time makes the game a bit more challenging too. And plus, it ends with a phenomenal boss fight I should have seen coming a mile away but didn\u2019t. It comes with a great story ending too.<br \/>Pretty much, as a fan to both Bioshock infinite and Bioshock, this is everything you could ever want in a short DLC. The developers delivered in every way possible and no true fan can really be upset about anything.","Digital_Video_Games"],"star_rating":4}

{"features":["I caught this game on sale for just over 5 bucks.  I loved it when originally released and played through beginning to end multiple times.  I'm halfway through again and can say the game still has that &#34;it&#34; factor of a good RPG - strong story, consistent character development, good voice acting, and a few plot twists along the way.  BTW, whether you've played the game before or not, you owe it to yourself to play through as a Malkavian at least once.  Ha!<br \/><br \/>Graphics are what they are - it was released in 2004, after all.  And there were bugs when this was originally released that still exist today.  However, the unofficial fan patches (still being updated after 9 years btw, which tells you how dedicated some folks are to this game!) do take care of most of these problems.  Yes, they engine is old which creates some weird physics but it['s still functional even today.  Today, this game is less about graphical beauty and more about what an RPG should focus on... story!<br \/><br \/>The story is pure, old school World of Darkness.  Everything is both seedier yet more fantastic than the real world and combining the story with solid characters and voice acting allows you to become immersed in the game world.  Linear play-through is certainly possible, but you will miss a lot of nuance and fun along the way if you just run from one waypoint to the next as seems to be the norm for most of today's games.  Maybe you found an old board covering a hole into a building completely unrelated to your current task?  Investigating it might give you an unrelated mission, tie-in to an existing missing in an unexpected way or maybe you'll get smeared all over the walls by something truly horrifying.  That's all part of the joy of this type of game.","Digital_Video_Games"],"star_rating":4}
{"features":["This is the first experience I have had with Tropico, after being a fan of Sims and Civilization for several years I thought I might try something new. I have to say Tropico is buggy, not user friendly at all. It does offer a a beautiful background, personalization for presidente, and the ability to build a city. However meeting the 'tasks' and building, especially the roads, can be difficult, if not impossible at times, and connecting areas across islands is next to impossible. I searched like crazy trying to find fixes to some of these issues without success. I uninstalled the game in the end and won't be playing again. I can tell a lot of people like the game so I don't want to put less stars, as for me it didn't hold me attention well and was more frustrating than fun.","Digital_Video_Games"],"star_rating":3}

It's like a mix of God of War and Ninja Gaiden, 2 of my favorite platforming hack-n-slash games, one being gratuitously bloody, the other being both gratuitously bloody and hard as nails! One thing that this did improve upon from God of War is that the QTE's (Quick Time Events) are a lot more forgiving and jump straight to before it instead of redoing the entire thing. I only played this for about a half hour, but that's not because I lost interest, it's just because I have a LOT of games I'm catching up on, and this isn't on the top of my priorities when I have things like Half-Life 2 and Dark Souls!

The campaign, although well written, is extremely easy, and broken up with WAY too many video clips. (not to mention there is no way to skip through the story)<br \/><br \/>Multiplayer is not all that great. Lobby, no dedicated server, no map options. Black Ops was much better.<br \/><br \/>Zombies. Was never a big fan of the whole zombie thing, so I can't really give an unbiased opinion on that.<br \/><br \/>In my opinion, if you want a FPS that is long and drawn out, this is the game for you. If you want a FPS that you want to just get in, kill things, and finish the game, don't get it.<br \/><br \/>Overall, I enjoyed the game, but I think it's a step back from Black Ops.","Digital_Video_Games"],"star_rating":3}

{"features":["I've been playing this game for 2 straight days and I am loving it. I was a little apprehensive because of all the bad reviews out there, specially of performance issues but thankfully for me, it's been solid.<br \/><br \/>I love playing third person RPGs (I don't like FPS or First Person RPGs), and story must involve me, otherwise I get tired of it easily. So since playing DA:Origins, All 3 Mass Effect and The Witcher 2, I've been waiting for this game a long time, since there aren't many good third person RPGs out there. (Skyrim is not good when playing in third person, and not really enjoying Dark Souls that much).<br \/><br \/>The Good parts:<br \/>There are other reviews here that go more in detail about the good things about this game but I'll detail a few:<br \/><br \/> - Graphics (I'm playing w\/ultra settings): The world's graphics are just terrific. I was watching some youtube videos and in my opinion they don't do justice until you see it in your screen. The environment, the effects are great. The characters' texture not as good, some shiny hair and a few other quirks that maybe distracting at first, but not enough to make it a negative.<br \/><br \/> - The Story: I'm not too far in the main story, but so far it has me interested. You know what your goal is right from the start, but they really make it so it is still a progression thing. (I always felt in the lord of the rings that Gandalf could just summon one of the big hawks to take Frodo all the way and end of story). This actually feels that preparation is needed. Questing also feels more natural than other games, part of the story, so it doesn't feel as if you were doing something else while the world crumbles. I like questing in this game more than in the aforementioned games.<br \/><br \/>- The Open World: It is big, plenty of exploration. It is incredible how little things like climbing into some mountains,that are usually closed areas in other games, are so accessible. You can see there is a lot of attention to detail when they built the world. It is very enjoyable.<br \/><br \/>- Game Mechanics: Again, I personally enjoy how this game plays in my PC, with a X360 wireless controller. That's how I like to play these type of games and I'm thrilled, maybe in a selfish way, that the gamepad support is 100%. So from that perspective alone, I don't see anything wrong with the game controls. The Inventory, UI and tactical cam are functional, and it is not all button smashing like some say, but it does have plenty of that indeed. The Game doesn't feel repetitive like other games (ex. Assasins Creed) where you have to the same over and over with the only thing changing is the stage.<br \/><br \/>Loading screens feel a little long but only when starting the game and loading the first save or when using fast travelling. Still, not long enough to make it a deal breaker for me, the longest probably was 30 secs. The reloads after you die are pretty fast in my machine.<br \/><br \/>The Bad:<br \/><br \/>I haven't found that many bad things about this game. From my perspective, the texture of the playable characters could be a little bit better, if they could get rid of the shiny hair and glossy lips\/face ,etc. I don't like horse riding, feels slow, and the wind effects around the horse are awful.<br \/><br \/>It taxes my machine pretty high, specially the CPU, which makes me think there could be potential for more optimization, hopefully with a patch.<br \/><br \/>The soundtrack is pretty good, and the effects are good. The voices (excluding cut scenes, decision making conversations) are sometimes too soft and it makes a big contrast with the environment, so I can't hear them at times, seems like there is not consistency. Rotating the camera helps, but it is a compromise. I'm using the home theater setting and I'm playing using an audiophile home theater system (not a HTIB).<br \/><br \/>Now to address some of the bad reviews out there:<br \/><br \/>1) Performance Issues:<br \/>I've been lucky so far I have not experience a single issue, no crashes, bugs, etc in 2 days, over 20 hrs of gameplay. Hopefully it stays the same through out the rest of the game(knock on wood). I did see some mild stuttering in the initial cutscenes, so I apply the 30 fps cap override command, no issues since, no lip sync issues either.<br \/><br \/>Some people complain about the game not running in their machines. Some seem very valid complains and I feel for them, they are experiencing directx 11 issues, black screen, crashes, etc. I was too unsure before buying the game, but I rolled the dice after Bioware announced they will look into it.<br \/><br \/>My machine is relative new, and mostly clean registry, I don't install too many things on purpose, so I'm guessing that's why I have luck. I used to have an AMD card, but recently bought an Nvidia card (this is not an AMD vs Nvidia thing) and I used an app to completely wipe out any AMD driver before installing the new driver to avoid conflicts. I would suggest you guys do a clean sweep of your graphics drivers and reinstall with new ones. Hope that helps but it is just an assumption on my part.<br \/><br \/>I'm wondering if some issues may stem from overclocked tweaks, I believe I read about it somewhere.<br \/><br \/>My machine, for reference, is an i5 4750S (low energy version), GTX 970 Strix 4GB card, 8GB system memory, Win 8.1 64 bit on SSD (Game installed on HD, game saves on SSD, no document folders redirection). It runs the game smoothly with Ultra Settings, except for tesellation on high.<br \/><br \/>Some people complain the game does not run in the dual core machine. Well, it is not supposed to if you read the game requirements. If you are not satisfied with it or can't explain why (and I agree to the extend they should have let it run with dual cores), that has nothing to do with the fact that you defied the minimum requirements and demanding for it to work. It is not how it works. You took a gamble and it didn't paid off. Don't knock on the game because of that. There are some allegations that some people are experiencing problems because they are running pirated copies.<br \/><br \/>With so many people complaining about performance issues, it is easy to assume Bioware did not spend too much time debugging the game so it can play smoothly in all computers meeting the minimum requirements. Again, they have acknowledge the issue and promised to develop a patch, hopefully it comes sooner that later.<br \/><br \/>2) PC Controls:<br \/>Well, I can't speak to diminish experience using keyboard and mouse because I probably wouldn't have bought this game on PC if I \"had\" to use keyboard and mouse. Not because I feel that all games shouldn't use K&M on PC's, but because I prefer to play these particular games with a controller. Other games, like Civilization, Total War, etc, RTSs, I wouldn't want to use a controller but a K&M. With all that said, I think that because most people have expectations that PC games should be able to use K&M 100%, I do feel it is a valid complaint and the developers should have been more forthcoming explaining the experience people were to expect if they wanting to use K&M. Hopefully they can fix that without affecting the gamepad experience. In solidarity, I knocked one star off because like people say, it is a PC game, and using K&M shouldn't be an optional experience, it should be the core. I just happen to enjoy the gamepad, so on my personal situation, my PC controls are A+ for controlling the playable characters, inventory, etc.<br \/><br \/>3) It is a Console Port:<br \/>Well, if you believe that particularly because of the gamepad taking precedence over K&M, then I would have to agree with that. However, I would ask you not to rally so against the game's ability to use the gamepad as it were a console for one good reason. PC Gamers complain about developers focusing on consoles because of mass market. It may not be better per se, but it is much more painless, less expensive and convenient for people to play on  consoles. The fact that I like using a gamepad for these type of RPGs, had me buying more games on X360 in the last decade than on PC. Because of the better support for X360 gamepad on PC games nowadays, now I'm buying more PC Games and I'm holding off buying the XOne or a PS4. So while I'm not advocating developers to ignore proper K&M support, you (the complainers) should not attack the game's ability to play like a console either, because it is helping PC games be more relevant. That is one reason SteamOS can't take off, and I think it is in the PC Gamers' interest that I does.<br \/><br \/>If you believe it is a Console Port because of graphics, other than the 30fps cutscene cap, I don't know what you are talking about, this game looks beautiful and that restriction can be lifted without much difficulty, and so far, it hasn't introduced any issues for me.<br \/><br \/>If you believe it is a Console Port because of the performance issues, then it seems like a wrong assumption to me. It only means they haven't spend the time optimizing the game to play good with most PCs. They should have before releasing it, like I'm assuming they are doing with GTA IV. However, I am evidence that the game can play on PC really good, and it doesn't feel like a PC port to me. This is by far better than other games previously released as PC only. Since i haven't play them all, I can't say it beats them all, but it does get high marks in my book.<br \/><br \/>4) Its open world it is not the same as Skyrim:<br \/>I take your word for it, but it is an open world indeed, non-linear, and it looks great.<br \/><br \/>5) It is not Skyrim:<br \/>Yes, it is not. this one is called Dragon Age: Inquisition. Totally different game.<br \/><br \/>6) It is not better than DA:Origins:<br \/>For me it is. I think it is a matter of personal preference.<br \/><br \/>7) It is not the game the plays in the way \"I'm entitled to\". the developer must cater to my very specific needs:<br \/>Well, I paraphrased a little bit, but I don't want to start digressing about what I really feel about entitlement societies.<br \/><br \/>I apologize for the long review, I thought it wasn't going to be this long initially. I do understand some of the issues with performance and K&M controls, but overall game feels like a winner. I was on the fence for a few days after release, waiting for a long time for this game to come out, and I have enjoyed so much that I wanted to let other people know that they should go through bad reviews with a tooth comb. It may not even apply to you.so many people complaining about performance issues, it is easy to assume Bioware did not spend too much time debugging the game so it can play smoothly in all computers meeting the minimum requirements.

If you believe it is a Console Port because of graphics, other than the 30fps cutscene cap, I don't know what you are talking about, this game looks beautiful and that restriction can be lifted without much difficulty, and so far, it hasn't introduced any issues for me.    If you believe it is a Console Port because of the performance issues, then it seems like a wrong assumption to me. It only means they haven't spend the time optimizing the game to play good with most PCs. They should have before releasing it, like I'm assuming they are doing with GTA IV. However, I am evidence that the game can play on PC really good, and it doesn't feel like a PC port to me. This is by far better than other games previously released as PC only. Since i haven't play them all, I can't say it beats them all, but it does get high marks in my book.    4) Its open world it is not the same as Skyrim:  I take your word for it, but it is an open world indeed, non-linear, and it looks great.    5) It is not Skyrim:  Yes, it is not. this one is called Dragon Age: Inquisition. Totally different game.    6) It is not better than DA:Origins:  For me it is. I think it is a matter of personal preference.    7) It is not the game the plays in the way \"I'm entitled to\". the developer must cater to my very specific needs:  Well, I paraphrased a little bit, but I don't want to start digressing about what I really feel about entitlement societies.    I apologize for the long review, I thought it wasn't going to be this long initially. I do understand some of the issues with performance and K&M controls, but overall game feels like a winner. I was on the fence for a few days after release, waiting for a long time for this game to come out, and I have enjoyed so much that I wanted to let other people know that they should go through bad reviews with a tooth comb. It may not even apply to you.","Digital_Video_Games"],"star_rating":4}

{"features":["I enjoyed most of the previous \"Stronghold\" titles, so I had high expectations for SH3. What a letdown!<br \/>The graphics are dark and muddy. The scenarios are difficult at any setting and hardly rewarding.<br \/>Worst was the total system freezing, sometimes early on, sometimes much later. Three times I had to shut down my PC and cold-boot. Sure, the read-me file tells how to fix this; by editing the .ini file for the game to match my system's screen resolution I got the gagging to stop, but soon lost interest in SH3 after that. When I started the game the first time I chose a screen size to match my system. Why that did not get into the .ini file is anyone's guess.<br \/>I think this shows a basis flaw with the Stronghold development - lack of talent. I've played many games at resolutions lower than my system default. The games reset the resolution when it starts and set it back to my default when it exits. Why does SH3 not have this basic ability? I think the 'Firefly' crew just doesn't have the experience to code such an ambitious game.","Digital_Video_Games"],"star_rating":1}
{"features":["Fun facts about this game: The studio that created it went bankrupt, so the game now belongs to the state of EDIT: Rhode Island, I believe. Anywho... It doesn't go on sale much since they have to get the state's approval (and if you've ever been to the DMV, you can imagine what that must be like). EDIT: EA owns the distribution rights now, so they decide when\/if it goes on sale, not fine state of Rhode Island. If you can get it on sale, go for it if you enjoy action\/RPG type games. I managed to pick it up for 75% off during the holiday sales, and it was a great purchase.<br \/><br \/>Seriously beautiful game with some unique features and elements of the fighting system. It's not completely 'hack 'n slash,' as it includes timed button presses for combinations\/special moves and has some really nice finishing move animations. The main story line is very good, but the side missions are often very repetitive 'go there, talk to that person, pick up this item, run back' affairs. Also, the voice acting doesn't really fit with the animations at times, and many of the NPCs look very similar (not enough variety in the gene pool I suppose) which can really pull you out of the game. Still, the main story is long and interesting enough and the fighting system is good enough that I would recommend this game if you can pick it up on sale.<br \/><br \/>Also, keep in mind that you've gotta have Origin to activate it.","Digital_Video_Games"],"star_rating":4}

{"features":["I'm sure you've read review after review about the awful server issues plaguing this game. Don't get me wrong - those are very valid complaints. However, nowadays, server disconnects and servers being full are (at least for me) very rare or nonexistent issues. In addition, I'm lucky enough to have a quick and stable internet connection, so the always-on requirement doesn't bother me. The game, however, is still fundamentally broken.<br \/><br \/>1. It's almost too easy. On my first attempt at a mining city, within 2 real-life hours, I was able to make $300,000 profit monthly. I was able to sit back and watch as my funds grew and grew with very little interaction from me. I wasn't sure at what I was supposed to do after that. It seemed like I had \"completed\" my city. I get that SimCity is not about winning, and that it's about designing your city the way you want to play. Trust me, I get it. But in previous games, there was at least some challenge presented, and it was more fun and viable to play around. Specifically because...<br \/><br \/>2. The cities are too small! Seriously. I know I'm beating a dead horse with this, but I cannot stress how small the cities are. Even basic infrastructure is hard to eventually fit in. Oh, your city has expanded to the point to where a new landfill is needed? Yeah, good luck with finding a place to put it. High demand for industrial zoning? That means nothing when the entire city is zoned already. The size of cities is simply ridiculous. They justify it by wanting you to share resources with other cities in your region and whatnot. It's still silly. There is honestly no motivation to continue a city once it's filled up. A SimCity with limited replay value? Unacceptable. Cities are so restricted that getting creative is just inefficient. Grid designs are the only way to really maximize your city.<br \/><br \/>3. Sometimes, things break for no reason at all. I'll get messages saying \"CRIME HAS THE UPPER HAND!\" begging me to increase police presence, and then the crime stats tell me 0 crimes are committed each day. It will tell me that buildings are without power, and then I look at my power, and have a huge excess. The problem will then go away a couple minutes later. This kind of stuff happens frequently. It's annoying, because it requires you investigate more than you should have to to see if the problem is real or just another lie.<br \/><br \/>4. It's impossible to manage traffic. Nothing more can really be said.<br \/><br \/>5. This game has been out for how long now, and we still don't have basic features like leaderboards? I know that those should take a backseat to fixing the broken game, but come on.<br \/><br \/>There are a few good points to this game.<br \/><br \/>1. The graphics are absolutely beautiful. It's been a while since I've played a more visually appealing game, and in a simulator at that. It's fun to click follow on random vehicles and zoom in. Your city really looks alive, and it's fun to just watch all the life around your city.<br \/><br \/>2. The UI is wonderful. Everything is easy to access. I've never had to look up how to do something. Everything is right there where it should be.<br \/><br \/>Those two points, naturally, are not enough to redeem this very broken simulation. Until they step up and do something about this game's issues, SimCity is not worth the purchase.","Digital_Video_Games"],"star_rating":2}
{"features":["Let me start off this review by saying that I LOVE, LOOOOVE TES games. I loved them ever since I first played Daggerfall (before all the patches that made it playable), and played Arena shortly after I finally finished Daggerfall. I have been following TES very closely from that time on. Heck, I even liked Redguard, and everyone I know tells me that game is terrible.    So I was extremely excited and ordered the Imperial Edition from GMG as soon as I found a 20% off code (I had to buy two copies, so I did not want to shell out that much for an MMO with a monthly subscription fee).    I have been playing this game for a while now (remember Imperial Edition gets a nice head start option), so I think I can finally give a decent and most importantly spoiler free review of this game.    Early access actually started off pretty well. The character creation is great, and both my wife and I were able to create the avatars we wanted. We also quickly jumped into a friends guild - and that is where our first surprise came... EVERYONE in TESO can SEE your ACTUAL account name. In fact adding a \"friend\" to your list, gives you their actual account name.    My account names are always weird and have nothing to do with my real name, but my wife usually uses a combination of her first, and last name. Meaning everyone and their grandmothers knew they were playing with a female. This lead to a lot of people (even those from our guild), that would start asking her where she lives, her age, and if she was hot, etc.    In fact a lot of \"friends\" that we met in TESO had their names and year of birth as their account name, since they were not warned that this name will be so freely and publicly available. Heck, some people even had their state in there! I kid you not, one of the players I met had FirstNameLastNameStateDOB as his user name. What an epic fail in this day and age to not CLEARLY warn users about something like this.    After we got out of the \"newbie\" areas, the game started to really lack polish. A LOT of quests were broken, requiring you to re-log and hope you get in the instance where the quest is working. The best part is that while you re-log, you can actually experience a character rollback. I completed a quest, only to re-log and find out that I never completed it. These random rollbacks had a very major impact on the game for us. We all lost money, experience, time, and most importantly LOOT and materials...  Moreover, a friend that was playing with us re-logged only to be greeted by characters that were not his. He called it a night after that. The issue was fixed the next day. That's right... There was some database linking error and the poor guy literally (temporarily) lost access to HIS characters. Not a big deal, since it was only the second (or third) day of playing, but this is unacceptable.    The game was taken offline for a good 10 hours (or more), and everything appeared to be fixed, however after playing for a few more hours we ran into broken quests once more, and more harassment for my wife due to her very obvious account name (that we petitioned to have changed with no response so far).    While I first loved crafting in this game, it involves quite a large chunk of time AND inventory management, making it lose its charm rather quickly.  Want to research and improve something? Well that will take 6, 12, 24 hours real time. You do not have to be on for this, but that is QUITE a time commitment. My biggest problem with this was when I started research on an item and logged into an alt. Came back a few hours later only to find that my crafter got rolled back and never started the research... So I started the research again and went to sleep, ONLY to log on the next day and find out that he was ONCE AGAIN rolled back to before he started the research. That was quite infuriating.    Now lets move on to the inventory system... Which is downright terrible as it gives you only 60 bank slots total... That are shared acrossALL your characters... 60 SHARED bank slots is a joke, since one crafter can easily fill those! Everyone in our guild is simply rolling alts as an alternative bank, and I personally have 4 characters with full inventories as my bank mules... I have people in our guild that have to use spreadsheets to keep track of who has what materials, and that is a pretty big design fail.  Either give each character 60 bank slots, with 10 shared slots on top of that - or increase the shared number of slots to 120+.    Speaking of crafting, most nodes in the game are guarded by NPC's, and since they are not instanced to your character - it means that other players WILL run up to the node while you are taking care of the mob and steal it, quickly running away as you finish the mob.    This gets even worse in dungeons. The best loot I have seen so far is either crafted or comes from a dungeon chest (not the dungeon boss). This means that you (or your group) can be fighting said boss, and some idiot can go loot your chest... So you get NOTHING. To make things even better, if you kick said ninja looter they stay in the dungeon with you and are free to continue ninja looting... What is this? I don't even....    The game is not all bad however. It does have some epic parts! You can become a vampire or werewolf, heck you can even get impregnated by a wasp and give birth to a waspling that will follow you around (and protect you), thinking you are its parent.  My most \"OMG\" experience so far has been riding through a forest and having my horse make a nervous neigh, only to find that it was scared of a wolf that was fairly close by. That is pretty epic and really made the world feel alive.  The quests and instancing also get an honorable mention. Although it is still a very theme park like game, I really enjoyed some of the voice acting and quests. The heavy instancing also makes it possible to feel like you made a real difference on the world.  Moments like that aren't too common, but they add a lot of extra to the world, making it truly feel lived in.    Finally lets move on the Pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, and the reason why I am giving this game such a low score (I would actually give it one star had it not been for some awesome moments).    As of right now, there are two HUGE issues in the game. Widespread duping (and it will get a lot worse when people find out how easy it is), and the client is being trusted with a LOT of things. I will not be saying exactly what, but a simple HEX EDITING program is ENOUGH to allow one to speed hack, teleport, have unlimited rolling AND dodging... Meaning PvP in this game is about to become utter garbage. The PvE is affected as well, but PvP is completely shot.  Apparently ZeniMax did not learn from the folks at Cryptic after they had plenty of issues due to keeping so much clientside. Google \"mmogfails\" and read up on their disaster. Unless TESO acts fast, I can see the same thing happening here. Also check the comments section for more info. I can't post links in this review.    I think I will give this game some time to mature, maybe a year or two, and play The Secret World and Guild Wars 2 in the meantime. Both are buy to play games, and do certain things better than TESO. The story in TSW is the best I have seen in any MMO to date, and GW2 does most other things better than TESO. As a bonus, neither game allow you to cheat and gain a huge advantage over legit players.    Sorry Bethesda, it really pains to give you guys a two star review - but certain problems with the game (mostly due to poor design choices) really hinder its enjoyment for the Mitchell family. WHY... WHYYYY trust the client in this day and age?    As a side note, I want to comment on how terrible ZeniMax support is (and not just because they haven't responded to my wife's account name change request after multiple days).  My acquaintance (a 62+ year old retiree that I sometimes do computer work for) was BANNED from the game due to a \"TOS violation\". After multiple (failed) attempts at contacting support, he finally got a reply and was un-banned after an \"investigation\" took place...  He is now literally done with the game. You lost a very big fan there, and it was all due to sloppy work. Not nice ZM\/Bethesda... Not nice at all.    I hope that you enjoyed my unbiased, spoiler free review of TESO. Now I would like to make a request of you, the Amazon gaming community. If you downvote my review, can you please post your reason for doing so in the comments section? I have posted nothing but our honest opinion and experience of\/with the game, and would like to know why I will be getting downvoted (and I know those are coming)... Unless you work for ZeniMax damage control that is, or never bothered to read my review and are downvoting simply because of the way I scored the game. Than feel free to ignore my request.    Anyway thanks for taking the time to read my rather large piece, and see you all around!    4\/11\/2014 UPDATE: Please check the comment section. There have been some interesting developments after I published this review.  4\/18\/2014 UPDATE: WOW, I didn't even notice that I started getting helpful votes. I really wonder how that happened. I was sure that this review would be forever buried and tagged as unhelpful.  4\/18\/2014 UPDATE 2: Oh I see. The dupe finally got out and people started looking a bit deeper. Honestly I am surprised it took this long, since anyone messing around in the guild bank had a pretty high chance of figuring out how to do this. We discovered it by accident and made a forum post about it... Only to have it deleted. Shortly after that it was all over guild chat and people were duping Grand Soul Gems and more. I honestly thought the dupe would get out that same day, but apparently I was wrong.  4\/19\/2014 UPDATE: Seems like ZeniMax introduced another bug into the game. This one will allow you to get unlimited mail (chests) from your hirelings. I simply don't know how to react tothe way they are running things.  4\/19\/2014 UPDATE 2: Earlier today I received an e-mail from a reader that asked to remain anonymous. This e-mail contains instructions on yet another dupe, and this one (like the original) will allow you to dupe everything. I just tested it out and can confirm it works. The author informed me that this exploit has existed since launch. I think I am going to call it quits with ESO. I don't want to reward incompetence with money, and most importantly my time. Consider this my final update to this review. I will be doing the only thing ZeniMax understands and speak with my wallet. Honestly, it seems to me as if ZeniMax is simply using the PC crowd as beta testers for their console release of the game. It is my firm belief that TESO will be buy or free to play within a year of its launch. My guess, sometime in early 2015, probably a bit before April.  I would also like to make a request. For the last few days people have been sending me quite a lot of ESO bug reports and issues. I want you all to know that I have no impact on them getting fixed. Please don't e-mail me regarding this game.  Edit: 5\/18\/2014 UPDATE: Although we no longer play The Elder Scrolls Online, I want to point out that ZeniMax DID in fact charge us both right out of the gate for an EXTRA month (on TOP of our \"free\" month of gametime). We were charged an extra $15 when we entered in our CD-Keys. This is unacceptable! After a few e-mails with ZM, the money was refunded back to my credit card, but that is yet another example of ZM's incompetence.

{"features":["This is the fourth and latest in a series of casual games based on characters from the 2007 ABC TV series \"Women's Murder Club.\"  The first three games were designed by the great Jane Jensen of early 90s' \"Gabriel Knight\" fame.  But \"Little Black Lies\" was not the work of Ms. Jensen.  It is just as good, however.  Graphics are more photo-realistic than earlier games.  It has spoken dialogs.  You play several characters as in earlier games, all part of a team of female investigators.  The staple of this kind of games, the hidden-object scenes, are all well done and should satify any fan of the genre.  The mini-games are fine too, and they offer a nice variety of activities, from knitting a yarn to using a microscope.  Upon finishing the game, don't forget to play the \"Epilogue\" (more like a prologue), which lets you play a brief scene as yet another character.  The game also comes with soundtracks and wallpapers as bonus features.  The story in the game is well-told, revolving around 30 years of \"secrets and lies\" in a small town beset with cult activities, hatred, and jealousy.  When the best friend of one of the female investigators dies while visiting the town, the game's afoot to find the murderer.  I got about 6 hours of gameplay at a leisurely pace, which is about right for this kind of low-budget games.","Digital_Video_Games"],"star_rating":4}

{"features":["I got this for 10 bucks on amazon on some sale. Lets just say that this game has no redeemable features. The SP campaign is generic, the multiplayer is nothing new and the extinction mode although fun, is not very engaging in the long run. The graphical requirements for this game is very high as compared to black ops 2, but it doesnt look any better.<br \/>A forgettable experience at best. I would recommend just sticking with MW3 or Black Ops 2","Digital_Video_Games"],"star_rating":2}
{"features":["I'm glad I didn't spend much on this because I don't like it! They dropped the ball somewhere because this is nothing like the previous versions of The Sims for PC. While the game seems smoother when playing and not as jerky, there is so much missing from it!<br \/><br \/>In the Buy menu, I noticed several things missing from the previous versions--<br \/>*Electronics is very minimal. There is no burglar alarms anymore which also means there's probably no burglar Sims anymore either. I didn't even see a home phone to buy!<br \/>*I didn't see vehicles either like there was in The Sims 3!<br \/><br \/>The other thing I can't stand is when you leave one property and go to another, you see a load screen instead of being able physically to follow your Sim like you could in The Sims 3.<br \/><br \/>I seriously hope they make some drastic improvements upon this game because I'm tempted to GO BACK and continue where I left off with The Sims 3. This is just very disappointing and I hope that future Sims games for PC don't follow this track.","Digital_Video_Games"],"star_rating":1}

{"features":["I am giving this game a 3 star rating mainly because it did make me put in at least 30 hours or so into the game and so on some level I enjoyed it but I was never wowed by anything (powers, skills, graphics gameplay mechanics and story). It is a grinder of a game but I was never really bored maybe tired but not bored.<br \/><br \/>I had some fun with it but I was not impressed with the power tree available even with the 4 DLC content included. I wish there was a teleport power or laser beam powers like Darkseid or something. I am very impressed with the character customization of his or her look though. I made 3 entirely different looking characters and powers. I beat the game completely solo and later online just for the extra challenge and I am sorry to say that this did not make me an MMO gamer. Kind of the opposite effect actually.<br \/><br \/>It is not a bad game but if you are new to MMO and are curious about it, maybe try the more popular titles like WoW or whatever because I chose this MMO solely because of the DC license and I can't help but think I maybe chose wrong  Either way, I am not going to pick up another MMO title ever.","Digital_Video_Games"],"star_rating":3}

This includes 1 code for BF3 base game, and 1 Premium upgrade code<br \/><br \/>Its significantly different from the Call of Duty Franchise, noticeably the operable vehicles, and the fact that you must compensate your aim for gravity.<br \/><br \/>I couldn't finish the campaign of this game, it felt like a generic FPS that focused on Multiplayer features.<br \/><br \/>COOP is super fun when you have friends to coordinate your actions, involving vehicle missions, night ops, etc.<br \/><br \/>Multiplayer uses PunkBuster and has been enjoyable for me. Most of the time I've spent on this game was either trying to unlock new equipment for vehicles, or different scopes for different weapons just to complete the set.<br \/><br \/>One thing that I needed to get used to was Battlelog which is used to browser and join servers.<br \/><br \/>Another application is needed for in-game voice chat with your party, so me and my COOP buddies used steam since it seemed like a simpler alternative.<br \/><br \/>I would've preferred not to use Origin, especially since it opens a window whenever a game opens, but this cannot be helped.<br \/><br \/>To my knowledge its impossible to use Steam overlay in BF3 without an application which I can link to if requested.<br \/><br \/>Seems like a poorly constructed review because it is, I mostly covered everything except for game play.<br \/><br \/>Also dedicated servers is a plus, but there isn't a modding community since modding tools are not available for this game. I do believe there are scripts for server maintenance though but I'm unsure about that.","Digital_Video_Games"],"star_rating":4}

Krugman   ps: Maybe I should have let the person sent card to that they would recieve a gift, no surprise then.","Gift Card"],"star_rating":3}

{"features":["I'd read there was no fees on product description, and i've been looking forward on amazon's site and I haven't found jet any intormation tha explains how I was charge of 319,31USD on a giftcard of 300USD. In fact this isn't the first giftcard i've purchased and never happend before... I am using a foreing credit card, so be carefull those on the same situation because I presume that this is a fee related to international transactions. Especially those countrymates from VENEZUELA.

{"features":["Every Christmas I received my daughter's Christmas gift wish list and would always order her some books from Amazon.  I thought that was a great way to shop and as I would purchase a few books, I never had to pay for shipping and the books would arrive here very quickly.  She now has a kindle, so I purchased a gift card for her so she could download the books that she wants when she wants them.  I just printed the gift card, put it in a box, gift wrapped it and put it under the tree.  What a great way to shop!!! It couldn't get any easier.","Gift Card"],"star_rating":5}

{"features":["Purchasing of this gift voucher was confusing and difficult to specify the amount.  I had a specific amount in my AU currency that I wanted to spend but the link that I thought would alter my choice sent me through to the &#34;purchase confirmed&#34; site.  I ended up having my preferenced amount submitted in USD (with the current exchange rate was quite significant). Will be more careful with purchases in future.","Gift Card"],"star_rating":2}

Amazon will not refund your money. They simply give you their gift card. Good business on the their part. BAD customer care, for us.","Gift Card"],"star_rating":1}
