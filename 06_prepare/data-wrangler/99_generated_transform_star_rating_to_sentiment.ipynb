My problem arises with origin and battlelog however. To play campaign(single player, no internet connection needed) you actually need to press play from origin, which will then launch the battlelog site, where you then have to click play. So basically, you need to be online to start playing campaign. So, if you're on a laptop with no internet connection, you can't play campaign. Battlelog also gives me an error online whenever I press 'quick match' from their site, so the only way to play multiplayer is by manually selecting servers.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />As of a few days ago Origin updated and allowed for offline play by selecting 'go offline' from within origin. Rating increased by one star. Also, it does come with a 'multiplayer head start' kit,  labelled 'welcome pack' in the Origin addons. I didn't decrease any stars for that(I thought I didn't get a head start kit) so no increase here. The fact still remains that there is no in-game way to select servers and the game must be launched for each individual server you join, thanks to battlelog.\",2012-11-29,21828191,64618519,3,16,19,0.0,0\n",

      "US,R118L572HO0IZE,B004ZGBMCK,UFO Trilogy [Download],Digital_Video_Games,N,Y,Five stars but beware of hardware problems,\"I've always been a big fan of UFO series. To me it greatly expands on the original X-Com games adding its own tactical combat engine and interesting story line that takes surprising turns. I have played all the three games that constitute this trilogy, UFO Aftermath, UFO Aftershock and UFO Afterlight and I enjoyed them immensely. I only was sometimes sorry that such a great concept ended up being implemented by a developer who clearly lacked experience or funding (or both) and shipped them not entirely ready for the prime time.<br /><br />Those who played X-Com games will immediately find themselves at home with the game split into two distinct parts. One is played on strategy level on a big, planetary globe showing bases, resources, moving enemy and friendly aircraft, etc. Here the player plans his global approach, research, development and production, advances career of his individual soldiers through training and specialization. The other part is tactical missions with face to face combat, limited number of soldiers being taken into fight (up to 7) and micromanaging every move, shot and piece of combat equipment taken into action. There are also differences. Tactical combat was turn based in the X-Com games but it is blend of turn based and real time play in the UFO ones. The soldiers and the opposing force move at the same time but the game can be paused at any moment either by the player himself or by one of preset events, giving the player opportunity to respond to new situation by altering his plans accordingly. Individual unit moves can be scheduled several steps (or shots) ahead. In the ideal scenario player sets actions and timing for his units while the game is paused, then unpauses it and watches the events unfold as both sides are moving simultaneously. Unlike in the X-Com the tactical battlefield can be freely rotated around any point and zoomed in.<br /><br />For those who decide to buy I recommend downloading the latest patches and some mods. My favorite mod for Aftermath is the one that allows extreme closeups. The unmodded Aftermath ships with the minimum (closest) vantage point being a little too high and far for my taste. The aforementioned mod removes that restriction and allows player to see the battlefield from as close as top of his soldier's helmet. I admit that the game clearly was not designed for that, the detail of textures and models is lacking at such proximity and some R-rated graphics can be spotted in places that normally would not be seen from the point of view allowed by an unmodded game. Still the mod is simply must have. For Aftershock I would suggest mods supplying uniforms in various camouflage schemes, digger restoration and name tag remover.<br /><br />-- PROS --:<br /><br />Familiar game concept taken from X-Com and expanded upon.<br /><br />UFO games are moddable and players community created several mods enhancing playability to a certain degree. More active members created modding tutorials and tools.<br /><br />Several patches have been released to fix more annoying issues and can be downloaded either from games' websites or from other download depots (like [...]<br /><br />-- CONS --:<br /><br />First two UFO games have been criticized for lacking features and for being buggy, with Aftershock peaking horribly in the complaint department. Aftershock seemed to be rushed into release with its frequent crashes, extremely long mission load times, broken grenade throw physics causing it to land in weird places and last but not least, a bug that derails the story line later in the game and prevents it from progressing towards the end. Some of those issues were alleviated by patches, the story line bug is fixed by a tool called Myrmecol Repair Kit (needs to be downloaded) or by editing a savegame file (instructions can be found on game's forum).<br /><br />The last game in the series was finally made right but it was despised by some for its somewhat cartoonish look.<br /><br />THE BIGGEST DRAWBACK of them all is rather limited support for video cards. I have all three games on CD/DVDs but I decided to buy UFO Trilogy from Amazon.com for my newly bought ultrabook that doesn't have an optical drive (Windows 8 64 bit with 4GB RAM, Intel Core i5 and Intel HD 4000 graphics chip). I immediately hit a wall when UFO Aftershock and UFO Afterlight refused to run, quitting with an error message related to a graphics feature. I searched the Internet for an answer and found that those two games CLASH WITH INTEL HD EMBEDDED GRAPHICS! Whether it is the developer's fault or the Intel driver's I don't know but I believe that no solution exists at this time (search for UFO Aftershock / Afterlight and wglchoosepixelformatAKB()). Fortunately I bought UFO Trilogy for only $5 so I can afford to wait and hope for the fix while playing UFO Aftermath, which runs without a hitch.<br /><br />Regardless of the problems, if you are able to run all three games I highly recommend this purchase.

      "US,RCF2JA8WWLZIE,B007VFHIHA,Hitman: Absolution,Digital_Video_Games,N,Y,\"Has its flaws, but still shines where it should\",\"With the return of Hitman after a 6 year hiatus, hardcore fans were psyched with a release of a seemingly flawless product, but questions remained as it neared release date. People now began to realize some major cons in the game, as I did with my further gameplay.<br /><br />Cons<br />-The disguise system is flawed, do not play on anything past normal on your first playthrough, my advice to you. This new 'instinct' system they implemented is the only way you can avoid being detected by someone with the same disguise as you, and they detect you at long distances!<br />-No weapon upgrades in Campaign! This bothered some people, but I don't care personally, and while they are still present in the new Contracts feature, I think that it wasn't a big deal leaving them absent in the Story.<br />-This game is not, by any means, Blood Money 2. If you loved Blood Money, and didn't care as much for any of the other games in the franchise, you might dislike this game. My advice to you is, DO NOT QUIT EARLY IN THE GAME. The early game is seriously boring, that's why I advise playing on normal, so you don't spend hours on levels that have no targets, I agree the levels spent simply evading Cops instead of killing targets is a bore, don't spend all your time playing this, advance!<br /><br />Pros<br />+Very long and enjoyable Campaign, I pumped about 15-20 hours in playing just it, although the story does fall flat, not only to me but others as well.<br />+Contracts mode is awesome! You know have the ability to travel back to stages in the Campaign, yet pick your own target from that level, picking up what you will from the level and setting the grounds for your own contract. This mode is a huge step for the franchise, and with the development of a new Hitman game already being announced, I would like to see them take this even further, with level modifications possible in addition to target modifications.<br />+The new kill animations rock! Being able to kill any target with truly anything you spot is a huge plus.<br />+New instinct system, while I think it was implemented poorly, it is a good idea in theory. The problem is that in order to hide your disguise (putting a hand over your head and hiding while walking past a guard) it requires instinct. I want an explanation as to why, in order for 47 to hide his face, he has to have some special superpower, if he runs out of it, guess what? He can't put a hand over his face. The system is very cheesy, but you learn to look past it and use it how it was meant to be. For more hardcore players you may want to turn all of instinct's help off and just use it to get past guards, because I don't see how this is playable without instinct to sneak past guards.<br />+Graphics are gorgeous! My fps was pretty poor, but my computer isn't top notch, even still I loved the graphics, seeing Agent 47's bald head finally rendered without choppy graphics six years later is actually pretty satisfying.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you like stealth games, buy this game. Hitman Blood Money, the game prior to this one, was strictly an Assassination puzzler. This game, however appears to be more stealh-based, sneak past without being spot, but they don't force you to play that way. The biggest gripe about this game seemed to me to be that Hitman: Absolution didn't turn into Hitman: Blood Money 2. The game developers sought to evolve the game, and you must applaud them for that. Whether all game evolutions are well-received or not, this is not some company seeking to pump out a repetitive franchise game.<br /><br />My word to you would be buy this game, if you played Blood Money, and liked it, BUY IT. You cannot know your opinion off one review, every person's opinion will vary. I didn't know if I truly liked the game until IO Interactive blew me away with levels like Blackwater Park near the end of the game. I don't understand why they decided to make these droll levels in such early game that seemingly discourages all new players from continuing simply because they are sick of running away!<br /><br />If you haven't played a Hitman game, but are a stealth game fan, boy will you love this game. You will get a lot of play out of this game simply by trying to progress every level without being spotted, and after finishing a level where you do so you will feel very accomplished. But as with every stealth game it can be aggravating, what I enjoy about Hitman is it gives you the choice, if there is a guard that has spotted you, you can hit him with a quick punch, hide the body, and be on as if nothing happened.

      "US,R3LFKMI73B17VH,B008Y21QAE,FEAR Ultimate Shooter Edition [Download],Digital_Video_Games,N,Y,A great shooter,\"First of all you get three full-length games. There is a huge range of guns, and lots of different locations. Yes, It's on rails, but a lot of fun. The guns feel solid, and have effects that are believable, while handling realistically.<br /><br />It remains a favorite, and this purchase was for a friend. My only personal complaint is the heavy dose of paranormal stuff presented in an almost endless succession of cut scenes that cannot be skipped. Be wary. Some of them leave you without a weapon in your hands. Do notice that, and select one before you find yourself in a fire fight. On max difficulty they almost never miss you, and you can only take a few rounds before you are dead. They are always bullet sponges.<br /><br />Ammo, health, and armor or weapons are plentiful and don't present much challenge. In every fight you are outnumbered three or four to one and more in major fights. It uses check points frequently, but there are also quick saves at any time as well as a formal save game at any spot. It's easy to pick up where you left off.<br /><br />After a couple of full plays of each game game, I use a couple of cheats (though in single player, I can't imagine who they think I am cheating - certainly not myself) and switch on God mode and Infinite ammo. It is a ball spamming turret guns. It is a whole new play style. The cheats are entered after pressing \\\\\"\"t\\\\\"\" and entered with return.  God mode is \\\\\"\"god\\\\\"\" and infinite ammo with all guns is tears, and finally kfa restores health and armour in case you get caught with god mode turned off as frequently happens after these cut scenes.<br /><br />For what it's worth, I am now on my sixth play-through of the series.  I now have 236 hours of fun from this game.<br /><br />At the current price, it's a steal.<br /><br />Good luck...\",2012-11-28,39117463,869519608,5,1,2,1.0,1\n",

While the plot is a bit ridiculous there is some good voice acting and some interesting characters. Overall, I think this game is a bit overrated but fun.<br /><br />The worst thing about this game is the horrible PC controls.  I literally thought my computer was broken when I tried to use the controls for the first time.  As others have mentioned you have to turn of in-game V-sync.  It can also help to increase mouse acceleration.  Even after all that the game is still difficult to control to some degree.  This game made me immediately think of Resident Evil 4 with its controls.  For the controls alone I took off one star.  Very poor PC support.\",2012-11-28,35140185,706806298,3,0,0,0.0,0\n",

      "US,R1TLS9S1KVW2A,B009XDMQ0W,Mass Effect Trilogy,Digital_Video_Games,N,N,This series is an achievement,\"It's a little hard to effectively describe these games as a whole, because a lot of gameplay elements change between them. In a nutshell, though, Mass Effect is a trilogy of run-and-gun squad combat action games tied to exceptionally strong storytelling and a vibrant setting.<br /><br />All three games do have similar strengths and weaknesses, though. Environments and scripted events are kinetic and interesting, and although the first installment may look a little dated, the design work is excellent. Combat has a tendency to get a little repetitive - the game's built in a way that encourages you to form a strategy and stick with it - but everything moves along briskly, so you rarely feel like any main part of the game turns into a slog. Your squadmates, selected from a pool of potential party members, all have engaging personalities and interesting stories of their own to explore.<br /><br />The real strength of all three games is definitely the writing. All three Mass Effect games have scripts that easily set standards for the medium, and the setting is vast and well-realized, with convoluted side narratives and history making for a complicated political situation that feels real and whole. The voice acting across the board stands out as the very apex of the medium, with special recognition going to Jennifer Hale's absolutely superb performance as the female voice of Shepard (the PC). They're also absolute marvels when it comes to player empowerment; you have the ability to determine your choices throughout the game at every juncture, and although some of these choices initially feel a bit gimmicky (there aren't a lot of actual consequences), by the end of the series nearly every choice you make in the entire run has some significant impact on the plot, characters or world. It's a feat that I've never seen matched in any medium, and the third game in particular does a phenomenal job of bringing all the possible twists of your personal ME decisions to coherent and consistent ends. In some ways it's also one of the most diversity-minded game settings available, too; the human cast is refreshingly multiethnic and gender-balanced (but more on this in a minute). The third game also deserves special recognition for being essentially a series of epic climaxes to series-long subplots with mind-blowingly awesome set pieces. Nearly every mission would qualify as the ending sequence of a lesser game.<br /><br />ME does have a handful of weak spots. Some of the minigames have been polarizing - the first one has you cavorting around in a goofy lander, which took a lot of flak for its clunky controls and shift in the game's tone, but I personally found driving it quite a bit of fun. The second and third both have variations on mining, which honestly are pretty tedious but also don't take long to complete. The games also feature a consistently iffy cover system that makes some changes over the series but never really gets comfortable. Don't expect much from combat customization - in terms of fighting, these are action games, not really RPGs. The series ending also got a lot of (deserved) complaints, but they did release a (free) DLC to expand it - and speaking as someone who never played the original ending, I found the resolution immensely satisfying and a perfect end to the series. Looking up the original ending on Youtube, though, I STRONGLY recommend making sure the expansion is installed before finishing the series (mostly it's just REALLY ABRUPT and full of plot holes the expanded cut fills in).<br /><br />My personal biggest complaint about the series is that the design work of the series overwhelmingly caters to the male gaze, sometimes past the point of being insulting. Women (especially in the second game) constantly dress like strippers even when there's no justification for it, and the camera loves to linger on certain parts of their anatomy at even the most thematically inappropriate moments, especially in the second game whereit gets so exaggerated that it often overshadows anything else happening in the scene. There's even an entire monogendered species whose core concept is that they're the paragons of beauty for all races, and of course they look like large-breasted space babes. What kills me about this is that these problems are exclusively design-related and don't reflect the writing at all - these same characters are also some of the series' strongest, and certainly not tokens there to be gawked at in any in-universe sense. The early series also suffers from some unfortunate implications in regards to homosexuality (it essentially doesn't exist, unless you're hot ladies, who are fair game for everyone). The third game does deserve recognition, though, for addressing that and including the best gay character I've ever seen in a video game. But obviously these issues aren't going to bother everyone (although really, guys, they probably should).<br /><br />Overall the series is one of the best ever made just for the story and characters alone, and the games are also beautiful and fun to play. I highly recommend them to pretty much everyone - whether you play games for the story, the challenge, the combat, the visuals or the feeling of a world reacting to your actions, the Mass Effect series is among the best ever made.\",2012-11-28,17329527,223982723,5,28,39,1.0,1\n",

Instead, I would wait til the games had been out at least a few months before purchasing it.  Sadly, I made the mistake of amending my position, to be only BioWare products.  My previous experiences with Assasins Creed convinced me that the company that makes, and produces this series of games, is doing everything right.  Sadly, I was wrong.  At least right now.<br /><br />AC3 is a very ambitious game continuing the series where AC Revelations left off.  So far so good.  However you quickly come across the flaws.  Missions, without a starting point, conversations that lack context.  Graphic issues, ledger problems that cause freezeups or crashes.  Or mission bugs that completely prevent them from being completed.  And other issues too numerous to mention.  You can probably work around most of the bugs.  Skip missions that are too buggy to work.  Read the forums for workarounds to get past the ones that are critical to the story-line.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fun game, And if you have enjoyed the AC series, Its definitely worth playing, its just that it would be a lot better to wait about a year, when the price comes down, and when they've finally fixed most of the bugs.  For myself, I'm going to take my own advice.  No more pre-orders, and in the case of AC3, I'll wait til they release a few patches, before picking up my save game.\",2012-11-28,49892779,784099575,3,1,2,0.0,0\n",

This creates a great sense of tension that makes the game really rewarding, and the levels are small enough that it doesn't get frustrating. Complementing the game-play perfectly, the story and atmosphere is really well crafted and incredibly unsettling. I relate it most to the movie \\\\\"\"Drive\\\\\"\", but more trippy. The music, the constantly flashing lights, the twisting crazy story, and brutal nature of the game-play come together in a great, truly unique package.<br /><br />other details:<br />the game took me about 5-6 hours to beat (which seems to be the average time), after which I promptly played through it again. second play through was a lot quicker, but still really enjoyable.<br /><br />There are multiple endings, to unlock the final one, you need to find a collectible item in each chapter of the game, which adds to replay value<br /><br />The game's soundtrack is really cool and all the songs are just files in the game's folder, so buying the game gives you access to the OST<br /><br />There are rumors floating around the internet of the possibility of a level editor, which would allow users to create and share custom maps, extending the replay-ability of the game indefinitely, and future dlc or a sequel are already in the works.\",2012-11-28,31923259,667892023,5,2,3,1.0,1\n",

      "US,R7CA9VEFJHFED,B009XDMQ0W,Mass Effect Trilogy,Digital_Video_Games,N,Y,Some extra info for those interested,\"As of the moment I'm writing this there are 5 Amazon customer reviews about this game and none of them are \\\\\"\"Amazon Purchase Verified\\\\\"\" (or whatever Amazon calls it). Heres some info I have learned for those considering purchasing the Mass Effect Trilogy (PC version):<br /><br />I purchased this game today (Cyber Monday 2012) thru Amazon (for $29.99 instead of the $59.99 price! Amazon is awesome!) and I activated it on the Origin client. I've never used Origin. The only Digital Game sites I have ordered from have been either Steam or Amazon (& the game required Steam) or Good Old Games (which is DRM-less btw).<br /><br />On the Origin Store I see that in regard to the Mass Effect games a \\\\\"\"points \\\\\"\" system is used instead of just stating how many dollars a dlc costs. Strike one. All points systems stink of ripoff imo (I think Xbox uses a point system but I've never played an Xbox before so this method of ripping off customers of a handful of dollars I am not used to).<br /><br />Here's how much Mass Effect 2 & 3 dlc will cost you in dollars. The dlc that adds to the story of Mass Effect (as far as I can tell) are the folowing (there is a digital comic also being sold but I will not list it since I'm not sure it adds anything to the story):<br /><br />Mass Effect 2 DLC:<br /><br />Lair of the Shadow Broker: cost 800 \\\\\"\"BioWare Points\\\\\"\"<br /><br />Overlord Pack: cost 560 \\\\\"\"BioWare Points\\\\\"\"<br /><br />Arrival: cost 560 \\\\\"\"BioWare Points\\\\\"\"<br /><br />Kasumi - Stolen Memory: cost 560 \\\\\"\"BioWare Points\\\\\"\".<br /><br />Mass Effect 3 DLC:<br /><br />From Ashes: cost 800 \\\\\"\"BioWare Points\\\\\"\"<br /><br />Leviathan: cost 800 \\\\\"\"BioWare Points\\\\\"\".<br /><br />So to experience the entire Mass Effect story you would have to buy \\\\\"\"BioWare Points\\\\\"\" and pay (if you buy through the Origin Store which I don't know if it's mandatory for ME DLC):<br /><br />BioWare Points cost:<br />1600 points: $20.00<br />1200 points: $15.00<br />800 points: $10.00<br />400 points: $5.00<br /><br />$35 for ME2 DLC.<br />$20 for ME3 DLC.<br /><br />Total: $55.00.<br /><br />So I payed 29.99 for the Trilogy. That would mean I would have to spend $84.99 in total if I choose to buy these DLC.<br /><br />In my opinion I believe the reason all ME2 DLC was not included was in hope that new players would spend extra on ME2. Not including all the ME3 DLC is understandable to me since ME3 is still less than a year old.<br /><br />I am a new player to the Mass Effect franchise. I have not played the Trilogy yet (it's currently downloading) but if the story is as good as everyone says it is (not including the controversial ME3 ending) than I guess I will pay the extra $55 for the story DLC. But at least I saved $30! Thanks Amazon! :)\",2012-11-27,20181758,223982723,5,232,262,1.0,1\n"
