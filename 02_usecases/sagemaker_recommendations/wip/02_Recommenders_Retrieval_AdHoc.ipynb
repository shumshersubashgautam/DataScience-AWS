    "Real-world recommender systems are often composed of two stages:\n",

    "1. The retrieval stage is responsible for selecting an initial set of hundreds of candidates from all possible candidates. The main objective of this model is to efficiently weed out all candidates that the user is not interested in. Because the retrieval model may be dealing with millions of candidates, it has to be computationally efficient.\n",
    "2. The ranking stage takes the outputs of the retrieval model and fine-tunes them to select the best possible handful of recommendations. Its task is to narrow down the set of items the user may be interested in to a shortlist of likely candidates.\n",

    "The Movielens dataset is a classic dataset from the [GroupLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) research group at the University of Minnesota. It contains a set of ratings given to movies by a set of users, and is a workhorse of recommender system research.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data can be treated in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It can be interpreted as expressesing which movies the users watched (and rated), and which they did not. This is a form of implicit feedback, where users' watches tell us which things they prefer to see and which they'd rather not see.\n",
    "2. It can also be seen as expressesing how much the users liked the movies they did watch. This is a form of explicit feedback: given that a user watched a movie, we can tell roughly how much they liked by looking at the rating they have given.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we are focusing on a retrieval system: a model that predicts a set of movies from the catalogue that the user is likely to watch. Often, implicit data is more useful here, and so we are going to treat Movielens as an implicit system. This means that every movie a user watched is a positive example, and every movie they have not seen is an implicit negative example."
