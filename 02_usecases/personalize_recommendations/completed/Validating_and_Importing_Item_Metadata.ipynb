    "\n",
    "This entire notebook focuses on just the item level metadata, you could clone it and repurpose it for user level metadata if you have that. \n",
    "\n",
    "To recap some of the discussion from the previous notebook, we are going to treat the action of a user tagging an artist as a form of positive interaction, and now we are going to look at the data on the artists to see what metadata may be available.\n",
